AB  - Transcription factor (TF) DNA sequence preferences direct their regulatory 
      activity, but are currently known for only ∼1% of eukaryotic TFs. Broadly 
      sampling DNA-binding domain (DBD) types from multiple eukaryotic clades, we 
      determined DNA sequence preferences for >1,000 TFs encompassing 54 different DBD 
      classes from 131 diverse eukaryotes. We find that closely related DBDs almost 
      always have very similar DNA sequence preferences, enabling inference of motifs 
      for ∼34% of the ∼170,000 known or predicted eukaryotic TFs. Sequences matching 
      both measured and inferred motifs are enriched in chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      sequencing (ChIP-seq) peaks and upstream of transcription start sites in diverse 
      eukaryotic lineages. SNPs defining expression quantitative trait loci in 
      Arabidopsis promoters are also enriched for predicted TF binding sites. 
      Importantly, our motif "library" can be used to identify specific TFs whose 
      binding may be altered by human disease risk alleles. These data present a 
      powerful resource for mapping transcriptional networks across eukaryotes.

TI  - Identification of transcription factors that regulate ATG8 expression and 
      autophagy in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 123-139

AB  - Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process in eukaryotes that contributes to cell 
      survival in response to multiple stresses and is important for organism fitness. 
      In Arabidopsis thaliana, the core machinery of autophagy is well defined, but its 
      transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. The ATG8 (autophagy-related 8) 
      protein plays central roles in decorating autophagosomes and binding to specific 
      cargo receptors to recruit cargo to autophagosomes. We propose that the 
      transcriptional control of ATG8 genes is important during the formation of 
      autophagosomes and therefore contributes to survival during stress. Here, we 
      describe a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen for transcription factors (TFs) that 
      regulate ATG8 gene expression in Arabidopsis, using the promoters of 4 ATG8 
      genes. We identified a total of 225 TFs from 35 families that bind these 
      promoters. The TF-ATG8 promoter interactions revealed a wide array of diverse TF 
      families for different promoters, as well as enrichment for families of TFs that 
      bound to specific fragments. These TFs are not only involved in plant 
      developmental processes but also in the response to environmental stresses. TGA9 
      (TGACG (TGA) motif-binding protein 9)/AT1G08320 was confirmed as a positive 
      regulator of autophagy. TGA9 overexpression activated autophagy under both 
      control and stress conditions and transcriptionally up-regulated expression of 
      ATG8B, ATG8E and additional ATG genes via binding to their promoters. Our results 
      provide a comprehensive resource of TFs that regulate ATG8 gene expression and 
      lay a foundation for understanding the transcriptional regulation of plant 
      autophagy.Abbreviations: ABRC: Arabidopsis biological resource center; AP2-EREBP:

AB  - The gaseous phytohormone ethylene participates in a lot of physiological 
      processes in plants. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS, 
      EC 4.4.1.14) and the ACC oxidase (ACO, EC 1.14.17.4) are key enzymes in ethylene 
      biosynthesis. However, how ACSs and ACOs are regulated at the transcriptional 
      level is largely unknown. In the present study, we showed that an Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) WRKY-type transcription factor (TF), WRKY29 positively 
      regulated the expression of ACS5, ACS6, ACS8, ACS11 and ACO5 genes and thus 
      promoted basal ethylene production. WRKY29 protein was localized in nuclei and 
      was a transcriptional activator. Overexpression of WRKY29 caused pleiotropic 
      effect on plant growth, development and showed obvious response even without ACC 
      treatment. Inducible overexpression of WRKY29 also reduced primary root 
      elongation and lateral root growth. A triple response assay of overexpression and 
      mutant seedlings of WRKY29 showed that overexpression seedlings had shorter 
      hypocotyls than the transgenic GFP (Green Fluorescence Protein) control, while 
      mutants had no difference from wild-type. A qRT-PCR assay demonstrated that 
      expression of multiple ACSs and ACO5 was up-regulated in WRKY29 overexpression 
      plants. A transactivation assay through dual luciferase reporter system confirmed 
      the regulation of promoters of ACS5, ACS6, ACS8, ACS11 and ACO5 by WRKY29. Both 
      in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)- quantitative PCR and in vitro 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that WRKY29 directly bound 
      to the promoter regions of its target genes. Taken together, these results 
      suggest that WRKY29 is a novel TF positively regulating ethylene production by 
      modulating the expression of ACS and ACO genes.

TI  - Direct and indirect targets of the arabidopsis seed transcription factor ABSCISIC 
      ACID INSENSITIVE3.
PG  - 1679-1694
LID - 10.1111/tpj.14854 [doi]
AB  - Arabidopsis thaliana ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) is a transcription factor 
      in the B3 domain family. ABI3, along with B3 domain transcription factors LEAFY 
      COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) and FUSCA3 (FUS3), and LEC1, a subunit of the CCAAT box-binding 
      complex, form the so-called LAFL network to control various aspects of seed 
      development and maturation. ABI3 also contributes to the abscisic acid (ABA) 
      response. We report on chromatin immunoprecipitation-tiling array experiments to 
      map binding sites for ABI3 globally. We also assessed transcriptomes in response 
      to ABI3 by comparing developing abi3-5 and wild-type seeds and combined this 
      information to ascertain direct and indirect responsive ABI3 target genes. ABI3 
      can induce and repress its transcription of target genes directly and some 
      intriguing differences exist in cis motifs between these groups of genes. 
      Directly regulated targets reflect the role of ABI3 in seed maturation, 
      desiccation tolerance, entry into a quiescent state and longevity. Interestingly, 
      ABI3 directly represses a gene encoding a microRNA (MIR160B) that targets AUXIN 
      RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF)10 and ARF16 that are involved in establishment of dormancy. 
      In addition, ABI3, like FUS3, regulates genes encoding MIR156 but while FUS3 only 
      induces genes encoding this product, ABI3 induces these genes during the early 
      stages of seed development, but represses these genes during late development. 
      The interplay between ABI3, the other LAFL genes, and the VP1/ABI3-LIKE (VAL) 
      genes, which are involved in the transition to seedling development are examined 
      and reveal complex interactions controlling development.

TI  - Arabidopsis BBX14 negatively regulates nitrogen starvation- and dark-induced leaf 
      senescence.
PG  - 251-268
LID - 10.1111/tpj.16374 [doi]
AB  - Senescence is a highly regulated process driven by developmental age and 
      environmental factors. Although leaf senescence is accelerated by nitrogen (N) 
      deficiency, the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms are largely 
      unknown. Here, we reveal that BBX14, a previously uncharacterized BBX-type 
      transcription factor in Arabidopsis, is crucial for N starvation-induced leaf 
      senescence. We find that inhibiting BBX14 by artificial miRNA (amiRNA) 
      accelerates senescence during N starvation and in darkness, while BBX14 
      overexpression (BBX14-OX) delays it, identifying BBX14 as a negative regulator of 
      N starvation- and dark-induced senescence. During N starvation, nitrate and amino 
      acids like glutamic acid, glutamine, aspartic acid, and asparagine were highly 
      retained in BBX14-OX leaves compared to the wild type. Transcriptome analysis 
      showed a large number of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) to be differentially 
      expressed between BBX14-OX and wild-type plants, including ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 
      (EIN3) which regulates N signaling and leaf senescence. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed that BBX14 directly regulates EIN3 
      transcription. Furthermore, we revealed the upstream transcriptional cascade of 
      BBX14. By yeast one-hybrid screen and ChIP, we found that MYB44, a 
      stress-responsive MYB transcription factor, directly binds to the promoter of 
      BBX14 and activates its expression. In addition, Phytochrome Interacting Factor 4 
      (PIF4) binds to the promoter of BBX14 to repress BBX14 transcription. Thus, BBX14 
      functions as a negative regulator of N starvation-induced senescence through EIN3 
      and is directly regulated by PIF4 and MYB44.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The major mechanism driving cellular differentiation and organism 
      development is the regulation of gene expression. Cis-acting enhancers and 
      silencers have key roles in controlling gene transcription. The genomic era 
      allowed the transition from single gene analysis to the investigation of full 
      transcriptomes. This transition increased the complexity of the analyses and the 
      difficulty in the interpretation of the results. In this context, there is demand 
      for new tools aimed at the creation of gene networks that can facilitate the 
      interpretation of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. RESULTS: Arabidopsis 
      Motif Scanner (AMS) is a Windows application that runs on local computers. It was 
      developed to build gene networks by identifying the positions of cis-regulatory 
      elements in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and by providing an easy 
      interface to assess and evaluate gene relationships. Its major innovative feature 
      is to combine the cis-regulatory element positions, NGS and DNA Chip Arrays 
      expression data, Arabidopsis annotations and gene interactions for the 
      identification of gene networks regulated by transcription factors. In studies 
      focused on transcription factors function, the software uses the expression data 
      and binding site motifs in the regulative gene regions to predict direct target 
      genes. Additionally, AMS utilizes DNA-protein and protein-protein interaction 
      data to facilitate the identification of the metabolic pathways regulated by the 
      transcription factor of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Arabidopsis Motif Scanner is a new 
      tool that helps researchers to unravel gene relations and functions. In fact, it 
      facilitates studies focused on the effects and the impact that transcription 
      factors have on the transcriptome by correlating the position of cis-acting 
      elements, gene expression data and interactions.

TI  - Transcription Factor AtOFP1 Involved in ABA-Mediated Seed Germination and Root 
      Growth through Modulation of ROS Homeostasis in Arabidopsis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137427 [doi]
LID - 7427
AB  - Ovate family proteins (OFPs) are valued as a family of transcription factors that 
      are unique to plants, and they play a pluripotent regulatory role in plant growth 
      and development, including secondary-cell-wall synthesis, DNA repair, gibberellin 
      synthesis, and other biological processes, via their interaction with TALE family 
      proteins. In this study, CHIP-SEQ was used to detect the potential target genes 
      of AtOFP1 and its signal-regulation pathways. On the other hand, Y2H and BIFC 
      were employed to prove that AtOFP1 can participate in ABA signal transduction by 
      interacting with one of the TALE family protein called AtKNAT3. ABA response 
      genes are not only significantly upregulated in the 35S::HAOFP1 OE line, but they 
      also show hypersensitivity to ABA in terms of seed germination and early seedling 
      root elongation. In addition, the AtOFP1-regulated target genes are mainly 
      mitochondrial membranes that are involved in the oxidative-phosphorylation 
      pathway. Further qRT-PCR results showed that the inefficient splicing of the 
      respiratory complex I subunit genes NAD4 and NAD7 may lead to ROS accumulation in 
      35S::HA-AtOFP1 OE lines. In conclusion, we speculated that the overexpression of 
      AtOFP1 may cause the ABA hypersensitivity response by increasing the 
      intracellular ROS content generated from damage to the intima systems of 
      mitochondria.

TI  - NAC transcription factor ORE1 and senescence-induced BIFUNCTIONAL NUCLEASE1 
      (BFN1) constitute a regulatory cascade in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1438-52
LID - 10.1093/mp/sst012 [doi]
AB  - Senescence is a highly regulated process that involves the action of a large 
      number of transcription factors. The NAC transcription factor ORE1 (ANAC092) has 
      recently been shown to play a critical role in positively controlling senescence 
      in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, no direct target gene through which it exerts 
      its molecular function has been identified previously. Here, we report that 
      BIFUNCTIONAL NUCLEASE1 (BFN1), a well-known senescence-enhanced gene, is directly 
      regulated by ORE1. We detected elevated expression of BFN1 already 2 h after 
      induction of ORE1 in estradiol-inducible ORE1 overexpression lines and 6 h after 
      transfection of Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts with a 35S:ORE1 construct. 
      ORE1 and BFN1 expression patterns largely overlap, as shown by promoter-reporter 
      gene (GUS) fusions, while BFN1 expression in senescent leaves and the abscission 
      zones of maturing flower organs was virtually absent in ore1 mutant background. 
      In vitro binding site assays revealed a bipartite ORE1 binding site, similar to 
      that of ORS1, a paralog of ORE1. A bipartite ORE1 binding site was identified in 
      the BFN1 promoter; mutating the cis-element within the context of the full-length 
      BFN1 promoter drastically reduced ORE1-mediated transactivation capacity in 
      transiently transfected Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts. Furthermore, 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrates in vivo binding of ORE1 to the 
      BFN1 promoter. We also demonstrate binding of ORE1 in vivo to the promoters of 
      two other senescence-associated genes, namely SAG29/SWEET15 and SINA1, supporting 
      the central role of ORE1 during senescence.

AB  - Position weight matrix (PWM) is the traditional motif model representing the 
      transcription factor (TF) binding sites. It proposes that the positions 
      contribute independently to TFs binding affinity, although this hypothesis does 
      not fit the data perfectly. This explains why PWM hits are missing in a 
      substantial fraction of ChIP-seq peaks. To study various modes of the direct 
      binding of plant TFs, we compiled the benchmark collection of 111 ChIP-seq 
      datasets for Arabidopsis thaliana, and applied the traditional PWM, and two 
      alternative motif models BaMM and SiteGA, proposing the dependencies of the 
      positions. The variation in the stringency of the recognition thresholds for the 
      models proposed that the hits of PWM, BaMM, and SiteGA models are associated with 
      the sites of high/medium, any, and low affinity, respectively. At the medium 
      recognition threshold, about 60% of ChIP-seq peaks contain PWM hits consisting of 
      conserved core consensuses, while BaMM and SiteGA provide hits for an additional 
      15% of peaks in which a weaker core consensus is compensated through intra-motif 
      dependencies. The presence/absence of these dependencies in the motifs of 
      alternative/traditional models was confirmed by the dependency logo DepLogo 
      visualizing the position-wise partitioning of the alignments of predicted sites. 
      We exemplify the detailed analysis of ChIP-seq profiles for plant TFs CCA1, MYC2, 
      and SEP3. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that among the three 
      motif models, the SiteGA had the highest portions of genes with the significantly 
      enriched GO terms among all predicted genes. We showed that both alternative 
      motif models provide for traditional PWM greater extensions in predicted sites 
      for TFs MYC2/SEP3 with condition/tissue specific functions, compared to those for 
      TF CCA1 with housekeeping functions. Overall, the combined application of 
      standard and alternative motif models is beneficial to detect various modes of 
      the direct TF-DNA interactions in the maximal portion of ChIP-seq loci.

TI  - The Arabidopsis transcription factor AINTEGUMENTA orchestrates patterning genes 
      and auxin signaling in the establishment of floral growth and form.
PG  - 752-768
LID - 10.1111/tpj.14769 [doi]
AB  - Understanding how flowers form is an important problem in plant biology, as human 
      food supply depends on flower and seed production. Flower development also 
      provides an excellent model for understanding how cell division, expansion and 
      differentiation are coordinated during organogenesis. In the model plant 
      Arabidopsis thaliana, floral organogenesis requires AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) and 
      AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE 6 (AIL6)/PLETHORA 3 (PLT3), two members of the Arabidopsis 
      AINTEGUMENTA-LIKE/PLETHORA (AIL/PLT) transcription factor family. Together, ANT 
      and AIL6/PLT3 regulate aspects of floral organogenesis, including floral organ 
      initiation, growth, identity specification and patterning. Previously, we used 
      RNA-Seq to identify thousands of genes with disrupted expression in ant ail6 
      mutant flowers, indicating that ANT and AIL6/PLT3 influence a vast 
      transcriptional network. The immediate downstream targets of ANT and AIL6/PLT3 in 
      flowers are unknown, however. To identify direct targets of ANT regulation, we 
      performed an RNA-Seq time-course experiment in which we induced ANT activity in 
      transgenic plants bearing an ANT-glucocorticoid receptor fusion construct. In 
      addition, we performed a ChIP-Seq experiment that identified ANT binding sites in 
      developing flowers. These experiments identified 200 potential ANT target genes 
      based on their proximity to ANT binding sites and differential expression in 
      response to ANT. These 200 candidate target genes were involved in functions such 
      as polarity specification, floral organ development, meristem development and 
      auxin signaling. In addition, we identified several genes associated with lateral 
      organ growth that may mediate the role of ANT in organ size control. These 
      results reveal new features of the ANT transcriptional network by linking ANT to 
      previously unknown regulatory targets.

TI  - Two bHLH transcription factors, bHLH48 and bHLH60, associate with phytochrome 
      interacting factor 7 to regulate hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis.

AB  - The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING 
      FACTOR 7 (PIF7) is a central regulator that promotes stem growth by activating 
      growth-related gene expression during shade-avoidance responses. Studying the 
      co-factors of PIF7 can facilitate understanding of the mechanism of PIFs and 
      light signal transduction. Here, we describe the identification of two bHLH 
      transcription factors, bHLH48 and bHLH60 (bHLH48/bHLH60), as essential partners 
      for PIF7-dependent modulation of hypocotyl elongation and function downstream of 
      phytochrome B. These two bHLH factors display DNA binding activity and interact 
      with PIF7. Genetic analysis indicated that bHLH48/bHLH60 and PIF7 are 
      interdependent in promoting hypocotyl elongation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis identified the substantially overlapping 
      downstream targets of bHLH60 and PIF7. Biochemical analysis revealed that 
      bHLH48/bHLH60 enhance the DNA binding ability of PIF7. These results provide 
      evidence that bHLH48/bHLH60 act as positive partners of PIF7 for mutual benefit 
      in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation.

TI  - Transcription factors KANADI 1, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 44, and PHYTOCHROME 
      INTERACTING FACTOR 4 regulate long intergenic noncoding RNAs expressed in 
      Arabidopsis roots.
PG  - 1933-1953
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiad360 [doi]
AB  - Thousands of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified in 
      plant genomes. While some lincRNAs have been characterized as important 
      regulators in different biological processes, little is known about the 
      transcriptional regulation for most plant lincRNAs. Through the integration of 8 
      annotation resources, we defined 6,599 high-confidence lincRNA loci in 
      Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). For lincRNAs belonging to different 
      evolutionary age categories, we identified major differences in sequence and 
      chromatin features, as well as in the level of conservation and purifying 
      selection acting during evolution. Spatiotemporal gene expression profiles 
      combined with transcription factor (TF) chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data 
      were used to construct a TF-lincRNA regulatory network containing 2,659 lincRNAs 
      and 15,686 interactions. We found that properties characterizing lincRNA 
      expression, conservation, and regulation differ between plants and animals. 
      Experimental validation confirmed the role of 3 TFs, KANADI 1, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 
      44, and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4, as key regulators controlling 
      root-specific lincRNA expression, demonstrating the predictive power of our 
      network. Furthermore, we identified 58 lincRNAs, regulated by these TFs, showing 
      strong root cell type-specific expression or chromatin accessibility, which are 
      linked with genome-wide association studies genetic associations related to root 
      system development and growth. The multilevel genome-wide characterization 
      covering chromatin state information, promoter conservation, and chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation-based TF binding, for all detectable lincRNAs across 769 
      expression samples, permits rapidly defining the biological context and relevance 
      of Arabidopsis lincRNAs through regulatory networks.

AB  - In plants, the organ size is one of the most important features and regulated by 
      an elaborate developmental program involving both internal and external signals. 
      The steroidal hormone brassinosteroid (BR) plays an important role in regulating 
      the organ size. BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) is one of important transcription 
      factors that regulate organ size in BR signal pathway in Arabidopsis. The 
      function of BZR1 on organ size is well characterized in Arabidopsis, but poorly 
      understood in maize (Zea mays). To understand the mechanism of intrinsic organ 
      size regulated by BZR1 during organogenesis, we identified the maize BZR1 and 
      examined its function in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of ZmBZR1 displayed 
      phenotypes of enlarged cotyledons, rosette leaves, floral organ and seed size in 
      Arabidopsis. The cells in rosette leaves as well as other organs in transgenic 
      ZmBZR1 lines were dramatically larger and longer than those in Col-0. ChIP and 
      RNA-seq analysis showed ZmBZR1 can directly bind to the promoter region of organ 
      size related genes, Germination Repression and Cell Expansion receptor-like 
      kinase (GRACE) and KIP-RELATED PROTEIN6 (KRP6) to regulate their expression, 
      suggesting ZmBZR1 is required for the progressive increase in cells during 
      Arabidopsis development. Collectively, our findings provide significant insights 
      into the mechanisms underlying regulation of organ size mediated by maize BZR1.

TI  - Arabidopsis Di19 functions as a transcription factor and modulates PR1, PR2, and 
      PR5 expression in response to drought stress.
PG  - 1487-502
LID - 10.1093/mp/sst031 [doi]
AB  - The Arabidopsis Di19 (Drought-induced) gene family encodes seven Cys2/His2-type 
      zinc-finger proteins, most with unknown functions. Here, we report that Di19 
      functioned as a transcriptional regulator and was involved in Arabidopsis 
      responses to drought stress through up-regulation of pathogenesis-related PR1, 
      PR2, and PR5 gene expressions. The Di19 T-DNA insertion mutant di19 was much more 
      sensitive to drought stress, whereas the Di19-overexpressing lines were much more 
      tolerant to drought stress compared with wild-type plants. Di19 exhibited 
      transactivation activity in our yeast assay, and its transactivation activity was 
      further confirmed in vivo. DNA-binding analysis revealed that Di19 could bind to 
      the TACA(A/G)T element and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays 
      demonstrated that Di19 could bind to the TACA(A/G)T element within the PR1, PR2, 
      and PR5 promoters. qRT-PCR results showed that Di19 promoted the expressions of 
      PR1, PR2, and PR5, and these heightened expressions were enhanced by CPK11, which 
      interacted with Di19 in the nucleus. Similarly to the Di19-overexpressing line, 
      PR1-, PR2-, and PR5-overexpressing lines also showed the drought-tolerant 
      phenotype. The pre-treatment with salicylic acid analogs INA can enhance plants' 
      drought tolerance. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Di19, a new type 
      of transcription factor, directly up-regulates the expressions of PR1, PR2, and 
      PR5 in response to drought stress, and its transactivation activity is enhanced 
      by CPK11.

TI  - GmbZIP152, a Soybean bZIP Transcription Factor, Confers Multiple Biotic and 
      Abiotic Stress Responses in Plant.
LID - 10.3390/ijms231810935 [doi]
LID - 10935
AB  - Soybean is one of the most important food crops in the world. However, with the 
      environmental change in recent years, many environmental factors like drought, 
      salinity, heavy metal, and disease seriously affected the growth and development 
      of soybean, causing substantial economic losses. In this study, we screened a 
      bZIP transcription factor gene, GmbZIP152, which is significantly induced by 
      Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (S. sclerotiorum), phytohormones, salt-, drought-, and 
      heavy metal stresses in soybean. We found that overexpression of GmbZIP152 in 
      Arabidopsis (OE-GmbZIP152) enhances the resistance to S. sclerotiorum and the 
      tolerance of salt, drought, and heavy metal stresses compared to wild-type (WT). 
      The antioxidant enzyme related genes (including AtCAT1, AtSOD, and AtPOD1) and 
      their enzyme activities are induced by S. sclerotiorum, salt, drought, and heavy 
      metal stress in OE-GmbZIP152 compared to WT. Furthermore, we also found that the 
      expression level of biotic- and abiotic-related marker genes (AtLOX6, AtACS6, 
      AtERF1, and AtABI2, etc.) were increased in OE-GmbZIP152 compared to WT under S. 
      sclerotiorum and abiotic stresses. Moreover, we performed a Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and found that GmbZIP152 could directly bind to 
      promoters of ABA-, JA-, ETH-, and SA-induced biotic- and abiotic-related genes in 
      soybean. Altogether, GmbZIP152 plays an essential role in soybean response to 
      biotic and abiotic stresses.

TI  - Heterologous Expression of the Transcription Factor EsNAC1 in Arabidopsis 
      Enhances Abiotic Stress Resistance and Retards Growth by Regulating the 
      Expression of Different Target Genes.
PG  - 1495
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2018.01495 [doi]
LID - 1495
AB  - Heterologous expression of a transcription factor (TF) gene in a related species 
      is a useful method for crop breeding and the identification of gene function. The 
      differences in phenotype and target gene expression between HE lines (with the 
      heterologous expression of an ortholog) and OX lines (with an overexpressed 
      native gene) must be understood. EsNAC1, encoding a NAC protein and the ortholog 
      of RD26 in Arabidopsis, was cloned from Eutrema salsugineum and introduced into 
      Arabidopsis. The heterologous expression of EsNAC1 retarded the vegetative growth 
      of Arabidopsis, and the transgenic plants (HE lines) showed much greater 
      resistance to salt and oxidative stress than the wild type, Col-0. The HE lines 
      accumulated 2.8-fold (8-h light) of starch, 1.42-fold of Chlorophyll a and 
      1.31-fold of Chlorophyll b than Col-0 during the light period, with obvious 
      differences compared to the RD26OX line. A genome-wide ChIP (chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation analysis)-on-chip assay revealed that EsNAC1 targeted 
      promoters of different genes compared to RD26. In HE lines, EsNAC1 could 
      specifically upregulate the expression level of TF genes NAC DOMAIN CONTAINING 
      PROTEIN 62 (ANAC062), INTEGRASE-TYPE DNA-BINDING PROTEIN (TINY2), and MYB 
      HYPOCOTYL ELONGATION-RELATED (MYBH) to show more effective abiotic stress 
      resistance than RD26OX lines. Moreover, DELTA1-PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHASE 1 
      (P5CS1), TRYPTOPHAN BIOSYNTHESIS 2 (TRP2) or GALACTINOL SYNTHASE 2 (GOLS2), was 
      also specifically regulated by EsNAC1 to retard the vegetative growth of HE 
      lines, but not the brassinosteroid singling pathway in RD26OX lines. These 
      differences in phenotypes and metabolism between the HE lines and the RD26OX line 
      implied that the differential features could be produced from the diversity of 
      target genes in the transgenic plants when the ortholog was introduced.

TI  - Regulatory mechanisms of the LBD40 transcription factor in Arabidopsis thaliana 
      somatic embryogenesis.

AB  - Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a process by which an embryo is derived from 
      somatic tissue. Transcription factors (TFs) have been identified that control 
      this process. One such TF that promotes SE is AGAMOUS-like 15 (AGL15). Prior work 
      has shown that AGL15 can both induce and repress gene expression. One way this 
      type of dual function TF works is via protein interactions, so a yeast 2-hybrid 
      (Y2H) screen was undertaken. One intriguing protein with which AGL15 interacted 
      in Y2H was LBD40. LBD40 encodes a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB)-domain TF that 
      is unique to plants and is primarily expressed during seed development. Here, we 
      confirm the AGL15-LBD40 interaction by quantitative assays and in planta 
      co-immunoprecipation. We also document a role for LBD40, and the closely related 
      protein LBD41, in supporting SE. To determine downstream genes potentially 
      controlled by LBD40, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput 
      sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used. More than 400 binding regions for LBD40 were 
      consistently found genome-wide. To determine genes responsive to LBD40/41 
      accumulation, RNA-seq analysis of transcriptomes of wild-type control and 
      loss-of-function lbd40/lbd41 was performed. Combining these datasets provides 
      insight into genes directly and indirectly controlled by these LOB domain TFs. 
      The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these regulated genes showed an 
      overrepresentation of biological processes that are associated with SE, further 
      indicating the importance of LBD40 in SE. This work provides insight into SE, a 
      poorly understood, but essential process to generate transgenic plants to meet 
      agricultural demands or test gene function. This manuscript reports on 
      experiments to understand the role that LDB40, a TF, plays in support of SE by 
      investigating genes directly and indirectly controlled by LBD40 and examining 
      physical and genetic interactions with other TFs active in SE. We uncover targets 
      of LBD40 and an interacting TF of the MADS family and investigate targets 
      involvement in SE.

TI  - The transcription factor WRKY22 modulates ethylene biosynthesis and root 
      development through transactivating the transcription of ACS5 and ACO5 in 
      Arabidopsis.
PG  - e14371

AB  - The WRKY transcription factor (TF) genes form a large family in higher plants, 
      with 72 members in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The gaseous phytohormone 
      ethylene (ET) regulates multiple physiological processes in plants. It is known 
      that 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthases (ACSs, EC 4.4.1.14) 
      limit the enzymatic reaction rate of ethylene synthesis. However, whether WRKY 
      TFs regulate the expression of ACSs and/or ACC oxidases (ACOs, EC 1.14.17.4) 
      remains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrated that Arabidopsis WRKY22 positively 
      regulated the expression of a few ACS and ACO genes, thus promoting ethylene 
      production. Inducible overexpression of WRKY22 caused shorter hypocotyls without 
      ACC treatment. A qRT-PCR screening demonstrated that overexpression of WRKY22 
      activates the expression of several ACS and ACO genes. The promoter regions of 
      ACS5, ACS11, and ACO5 were also activated by WRKY22, which was revealed by a dual 
      luciferase reporter assay. A follow-up chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with 
      quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) 
      showed that the promoter regions of ACS5 and ACO5 could be bound by WRKY22 
      directly. Moreover, wrky22 mutants had longer primary roots and more lateral 
      roots than wild type, while WRKY22-overexpressing lines showed the opposite 
      phenotype. In conclusion, this study revealed that WRKY22 acts as a novel TF 
      activating, at least, the expression of ACS5 and ACO5 to increase ethylene 
      synthesis and modulate root development.

AB  - Motivation: The increasing availability of chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data enables us to learn more about the action of 
      transcription factors in the regulation of gene expression. Even though in vivo 
      transcriptional regulation often involves the concerted action of more than one 
      transcription factor, the format of each individual ChIP-Seq dataset usually 
      represents the action of a single transcription factor. Therefore, a relational 
      database in which available ChIP-Seq datasets are curated is essential. Results: 
      We present Expresso (database and webserver) as a tool for the collection and 
      integration of available Arabidopsis ChIP-Seq peak data, which in turn can be 
      linked to a user's gene expression data. Known target genes of transcription 
      factors were identified by motif analysis of publicly available GEO ChIP-Seq data 
      sets. Expresso currently provides three services: 1) Identification of target 
      genes of a given transcription factor; 2) Identification of transcription factors 
      that regulate a gene of interest; 3) Computation of correlation between the gene 
      expression of transcription factors and their target genes. Availability:

TI  - Transcription factor WRKY46 modulates the development of Arabidopsis lateral 
      roots in osmotic/salt stress conditions via regulation of ABA signaling and auxin 
      homeostasis.
PG  - 56-69
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12958 [doi]
AB  - The development of lateral roots (LR) is known to be severely inhibited by salt 
      or osmotic stress. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LR development in 
      osmotic/salt stress conditions are poorly understood. Here we show that the gene 
      encoding the WRKY transcription factor WRKY46 (WRKY46) is expressed throughout 
      lateral root primordia (LRP) during early LR development and that expression is 
      subsequently restricted to the stele of the mature LR. In osmotic/salt stress 
      conditions, lack of WRKY46 (in loss-of-function wrky46 mutants) significantly 
      reduces, while overexpression of WRKY46 enhances, LR development. We also show 
      that exogenous auxin largely restores LR development in wrky46 mutants, and that 
      the auxin transport inhibitor 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) inhibits LR 
      development in both wild-type (WT; Col-0) and in a line overexpressing WRKY46 
      (OV46). Subsequent analysis of abscisic acid (ABA)-related mutants indicated that 
      WRKY46 expression is down-regulated by ABA signaling, and up-regulated by an 
      ABA-independent signal induced by osmotic/salt stress. Next, we show that 
      expression of the DR5:GUS auxin response reporter is reduced in roots of wrky46 
      mutants, and that both wrky46 mutants and OV46 display altered root levels of 
      free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and IAA conjugates. Subsequent RT-qPCR and 
      ChIP-qPCR experiments indicated that WRKY46 directly regulates the expression of 
      ABI4 and of genes regulating auxin conjugation. Finally, analysis of wrky46 abi4 
      double mutant plants confirms that ABI4 acts downstream of WRKY46. In summary, 
      our results demonstrate that WRKY46 contributes to the feedforward inhibition of 
      osmotic/salt stress-dependent LR inhibition via regulation of ABA signaling and 
      auxin homeostasis.

TI  - Transcription factor HAT1 is phosphorylated by BIN2 kinase and mediates 
      brassinosteroid repressed gene expression in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 59-70

AB  - Plant steroid hormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), play essential roles in 
      modulating cell elongation, vascular differentiation, senescence and stress 
      responses. BRs signal through plasma membrane-localized receptor and other 
      components to modulate the BES1/BZR1 (BRI1-EMS SUPPRESSOR 1/BRASSINAZOLE 
      RESISTANT 1) family of transcription factors that modulate thousands of target 
      genes. Arabodopsis thaliana homeodomain-leucine zipper protein 1 (HAT1), which 
      encodes a homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) class II transcription factor, was 
      identified through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments as a direct 
      target gene of BES1. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants of HAT1 
      display altered BR responses. HAT1 and its close homolog HAT3 act redundantly, as 
      the double mutant hat1 hat3 displayed a reduced BR response that is stronger than 
      the single mutants alone. Moreover, hat1 hat3 enhanced the phenotype of a weak 
      allele of the BR receptor mutant bri1 and suppressed the phenotype of 
      constitutive BR response mutant bes1-D. These results suggest that HAT1 and HAT3 
      function to activate BR-mediated growth. Expression levels of several 
      BR-repressed genes are increased in hat1 hat3 and reduced in HAT1OX, suggesting 
      that HAT1 functions to repress the expression of a subset of BR target genes. 
      HAT1 and BES1 bind to a conserved homeodomain binding (HB) site and BR response 
      element (BRRE) respectively, in the promoters of some BR-repressed genes. BES1 
      and HAT1 interact with each other and cooperate to inhibit BR-repressed gene 
      expression. Furthermore, HAT1 can be phosphorylated and stabilized by GSK3 
      (GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3)-like kinase BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 2), a 
      well established negative regulator of the BR pathway. Our results thus revealed 
      a previously unknown mechanism by which BR signaling modulates BR-repressed gene 
      expression and coordinates plant growth.

TI  - Transcription Factor GmWRKY46 Enhanced Phosphate Starvation Tolerance and Root 
      Development in Transgenic Plants.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is one of the essential macronutrients, whose deficiency limits 
      the growth and development of plants. In this study, we investigated the possible 
      role of GmWRKY46 in the phosphate (Pi) starvation stress tolerance of soybean. 
      GmWRKY46 belonged to the group III subfamily of the WRKY transcription factor 
      family, which was localized in the nucleus and had transcriptional activator 
      activity. GmWRKY46 could be strongly induced by Pi starvation, especially in 
      soybean roots. Overexpression of GmWRKY46 significantly enhanced tolerance to Pi 
      starvation and lateral root development in transgenic Arabidopsis. RNA-seq 
      analysis showed that overexpression of GmWRKY46 led to change in many genes 
      related to energy metabolisms, stress responses, and plant hormone signal 
      transduction in transgenic Arabidopsis. Among these differential expression 
      genes, we found that overexpression of AtAED1 alone could enhance the tolerance 
      of transgenic Arabidopsis to Pi starvation. Y1H and ChIP-qPCR analyses showed 
      that GmWRKY46 could directly bind to the W-box motif of the AtAED1 promoter in 
      vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, results from intact soybean composite plants with 
      GmWRKY46 overexpression showed that GmWRKY46 was involved in hairy roots 
      development and subsequently affected plant growth and Pi uptake. These results 
      provide a basis for the molecular genetic breeding of soybean tolerant to Pi 
      starvation.

TI  - "Hit-and-run": Transcription factors get caught in the act.
PG  - 748-54
LID - 10.1002/bies.201400186 [doi]
AB  - A key challenge for understanding transcriptional regulation is being able to 
      measure transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding events with sufficient spatial and 
      temporal resolution; that is, when and where TFs occupy their cognate sites. A 
      recent study by Para et al. has highlighted the dynamics underlying the 
      activation of gene expression by a master regulator TF. This study provides 
      concrete evidence for a long-standing hypothesis in biology, the "hit-and-run" 
      mechanism, which was first proposed decades ago. That is, gene expression is 
      dynamically controlled by a TF that transiently binds and activates a target 
      gene, which might stay in a transcriptionally active state after the initial 
      binding event has ended. Importantly, the experimental procedure introduced, 
      TARGET, provides a useful way for identifying multiple target genes transiently 
      bound by their regulators, which can be used in conjunction with other 
      well-established methods to improve our understanding of transcriptional 
      regulatory dynamics.

TI  - The SNAC-A Transcription Factor ANAC032 Reprograms Metabolism in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 999-1010
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcz015 [doi]
AB  - Studies have indicated that the carbon starvation response leads to the 
      reprogramming of the transcriptome and metabolome, and many genes, including 
      several important regulators, such as the group S1 basic leucine zipper 
      transcription factors (TFs) bZIP1, bZIP11 and bZIP53, the SNAC-A TF ATAF1, etc., 
      are involved in these physiological processes. Here, we show that the SNAC-A TF 
      ANAC032 also plays important roles in this process. The overexpression of ANAC032 
      inhibits photosynthesis and induces reactive oxygen species accumulation in 
      chloroplasts, thereby reducing sugar accumulation and resulting in carbon 
      starvation. ANAC032 reprograms carbon and nitrogen metabolism by increasing sugar 
      and amino acid catabolism in plants. The ChIP-qPCR and transient dual-luciferase 
      reporter assays indicated that ANAC032 regulates trehalose metabolism via the 
      direct regulation of TRE1 expression. Taken together, these results show that 
      ANAC032 is an important regulator of the carbon/energy status that represses 
      photosynthesis to induce carbon starvation.

TI  - Maize transcription factor ZmBES1/BZR1-5 positively regulates kernel size.
PG  - 1714-1726
LID - 10.1093/jxb/eraa544 [doi]
AB  - The BES1/BZR1 transcription factors regulate the expression of genes responsive 
      to brassinosteroids and play pivotal roles in plant development, but their role 
      in regulating kernel development in maize remains unclear. In this study, we 
      found that ZmBES1/BZR1-5 positively regulates kernel size. Association analysis 
      of candidate genes in 513 diverse maize inbred lines indicated that three SNPs 
      related to ZmBES1/BZR1-5 were significantly associated with kernel width and 
      whilst four SNPs were related to 100-kernel weight. Overexpression of 
      ZmBES1/BZR1-5 in Arabidopsis and rice both significantly increased seed size and 
      weight, and smaller kernels were produced in maize Mu transposon insertion and 
      EMS mutants. The ZmBES1/BZR1-5 protein locates in the nucleus, contains bHLH and 
      BAM domains, and shows no transcriptional activity as a monomer but forms a 
      homodimer through the BAM domain. ChIP-sequencing analysis, and yeast one-hybrid 
      and dual-luciferase assays demonstrated that the protein binds to the promoters 
      of AP2/EREBP genes (Zm00001d010676 and Zm00001d032077) and inhibits their 
      transcription. cDNA library screening showed that ZmBES1/BZR1-5 interacts with 
      casein kinase II subunit β4 (ZmCKIIβ4) and ferredoxin 2 (ZmFdx2) in vitro and in 
      vivo, respectively. Taken together, our study suggests that ZmBES1/BZR1-5 
      positively regulates kernel size, and provides new insights into understanding 
      the mechanisms of kernel development in maize.

AB  - A regulon refers to a group of genes regulated by a transcription factor binding 
      to regulatory motifs to achieve specific biological functions. To infer 
      tissue-specific gene regulons in Arabidopsis, we developed a novel pipeline named 
      InferReg. InferReg utilizes a gene expression matrix that includes 3400 
      Arabidopsis transcriptomes to make initial predictions about the regulatory 
      relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes (TGs) using 
      co-expression patterns. It further improves these anticipated interactions by 
      integrating TF binding site enrichment analysis to eliminate false positives that 
      are only supported by expression data. InferReg further trained a graph 
      convolutional network with 133 transcription factors, supported by ChIP-seq, as 
      positive samples, to learn the regulatory logic between TFs and TGs to improve 
      the accuracy of the regulatory network. To evaluate the functionality of 
      InferReg, we utilized it to discover tissue-specific regulons in 5 Arabidopsis 
      tissues: flower, leaf, root, seed, and seedling. We ranked the activities of 
      regulons for each tissue based on reliability using Borda ranking and compared 
      them with existing databases. The results demonstrated that InferReg not only 
      identified known tissue-specific regulons but also discovered new ones. By 
      applying InferReg to rice expression data, we were able to identify rice 
      tissue-specific regulons, showing that our approach can be applied more broadly. 
      We used InferReg to successfully identify important regulons in various tissues 
      of Arabidopsis and Oryza, which has improved our understanding of tissue-specific 
      regulations and the roles of regulons in tissue differentiation and development.

TI  - The MADS-domain factor AGAMOUS-Like18 promotes somatic embryogenesis.
PG  - 1617-1631
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiab553 [doi]
AB  - AGAMOUS-Like 18 (AGL18) is a MADS domain transcription factor (TF) that is 
      structurally related to AGL15. Here we show that, like AGL15, AGL18 can promote 
      somatic embryogenesis (SE) when ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
      thaliana). Based on loss-of-function mutants, AGL15 and AGL18 have redundant 
      functions in developmental processes such as SE. To understand the nature of this 
      redundancy, we undertook a number of studies to look at the interaction between 
      these factors. We studied the genome-wide direct targets of AGL18 to characterize 
      its roles at the molecular level using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-SEQ 
      combined with RNA-SEQ. The results demonstrated that AGL18 binds to thousands of 
      sites in the genome. Comparison of ChIP-SEQ data for AGL15 and AGL18 revealed 
      substantial numbers of genes bound by both AGL15 and AGL18, but there were also 
      differences. Gene ontology analysis revealed that target genes were enriched for 
      seed, embryo, and reproductive development as well as hormone and stress 
      responses. The results also demonstrated that AGL15 and AGL18 interact in a 
      complex regulatory loop, where AGL15 inhibited transcript accumulation of AGL18, 
      while AGL18 increased AGL15 transcript accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation 
      revealed an interaction between AGL18 and AGL15 in somatic embryo tissue. The 
      binding and expression analyses revealed a complex crosstalk and interactions 
      among embryo TFs and their target genes. In addition, our study also revealed 
      that phosphorylation of AGL18 and AGL15 was crucial for the promotion of SE.

TI  - The GATA transcription factor TaGATA1 recruits demethylase TaELF6-A1 and enhances 
      seed dormancy in wheat by directly regulating TaABI5.
PG  - 1262-1276
LID - 10.1111/jipb.13437 [doi]
AB  - Seed dormancy is an important agronomic trait in crops, and plants with low 
      dormancy are prone to preharvest sprouting (PHS) under high-temperature and humid 
      conditions. In this study, we report that the GATA transcription factor TaGATA1 
      is a positive regulator of seed dormancy by regulating TaABI5 expression in 
      wheat. Our results demonstrate that TaGATA1 overexpression significantly enhances 
      seed dormancy and increases resistance to PHS in wheat. Gene expression patterns, 
      abscisic acid (ABA) response assay, and transcriptome analysis all indicate that 
      TaGATA1 functions through the ABA signaling pathway. The transcript abundance of 
      TaABI5, an essential regulator in the ABA signaling pathway, is significantly 
      elevated in plants overexpressing TaGATA1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay 
      (ChIP) and transient expression analysis showed that TaGATA1 binds to the GATA 
      motifs at the promoter of TaABI5 and induces its expression. We also demonstrate 
      that TaGATA1 physically interacts with the putative demethylase TaELF6-A1, the 
      wheat orthologue of Arabidopsis ELF6. ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that H3K27me3 
      levels significantly decline at the TaABI5 promoter in the TaGATA1-overexpression 
      wheat line and that transient expression of TaELF6-A1 reduces methylation levels 
      at the TaABI5 promoter, increasing TaABI5 expression. These findings reveal a new 
      transcription module, including TaGATA1-TaELF6-A1-TaABI5, which contributes to 
      seed dormancy through the ABA signaling pathway and epigenetic reprogramming at 
      the target site. TaGATA1 could be a candidate gene for improving PHS resistance.

AB  - In contrast to animals, plant development involves continuous organ formation, 
      which requires strict regulation of cell proliferation. The core cell cycle 
      machinery is conserved across plants and animals, but plants have developed new 
      mechanisms that precisely regulate cell proliferation in response to internal and 
      external stimuli. Here, we report that the DOF transcription factor OBP4 
      negatively regulates cell proliferation and expansion. OBP4 is a nuclear protein. 
      Constitutive and inducible overexpression of OBP4 reduced the cell size and 
      number, resulting in dwarf plants. Inducible overexpression of OBP4 in 
      Arabidopsis also promoted early endocycle onset and inhibited cell expansion, 
      while inducible overexpression of OBP4 fused to the VP16 activation domain in 
      Arabidopsis delayed endocycle onset and promoted plant growth. Furthermore, gene 
      expression analysis showed that cell cycle regulators and cell wall expansion 
      factors were largely down-regulated in the OBP4 overexpression lines. Short-term 
      inducible analysis coupled with in vivo ChIP assays indicated that OBP4 targets 
      the CyclinB1;1, CDKB1;1 and XTH genes. These results strongly suggest that OBP4 
      is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression and cell growth. These findings 
      increase our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle in 
      plants.

AB  - The circadian clock is a self-sustaining 24 h timekeeper which enables plants to 
      anticipate periodic environmental changes and optimize the biological activities 
      for most beneficial time during day/night cycles. As in many organisms, the 
      sustained circadian rhythmicity in plant relies on network of 
      transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFLs) of transcription factors at 
      the core of the oscillator. Over the past years, ChIP-seq has become an 
      indispensable method to uncover the clock network through identifications of 
      circadian transcription factors binding sites on a genome-wide scale. Here, we 
      show how to use ChIP-seq to analyze the occupancy of circadian transcription 
      factor in Arabidopsis. In addition, we briefly describe some modifications of 
      protocol applied to rice (Oryza sativa).

      Species Accumulation in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Leaf senescence is a highly complex genetic process that is finely tuned by 
      multiple layers of regulation. Among them, transcriptional regulation plays a 
      critical role in controlling the initiation and progression of leaf senescence. 
      Here, we found that the NAC transcription factor NAC075 functions as a novel 
      negative regulator of leaf senescence. Loss of function of NAC075 promotes leaf 
      senescence in an age-dependent manner, whereas constitutive overexpression of 
      NAC075 delays senescence in Arabidopsis. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 
      transcript levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), ascorbate 
      peroxidase (APX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) are significantly suppressed in 
      nac075 mutants compared with wild-type plants. Electrophoretic mobility shift 
      assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses revealed that 
      NAC075 directly binds the promoter of catalase 2 (CAT2). Moreover, genetic 
      analysis showed that overexpression of CAT2 suppresses the overproduction of 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the early senescence phenotypes of nac075 
      mutants, suggesting that CAT2 acts downstream of NAC075 to delay leaf senescence 
      by repressing ROS accumulation. Collectively, our findings provide a new 
      regulatory module involving NAC075-CAT2-ROS in controlling leaf senescence in 
      Arabidopsis.

AB  - Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with high-throughput techniques 
      (ChIP-X), such as next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and microarray 
      (ChIP-chip), has been successfully used to map active transcription factor 
      binding sites (TFBS) of a transcription factor (TF). The targeted genes can be 
      activated or suppressed by the TF, or are unresponsive to the TF. Microarray 
      technology has been used to measure the actual expression changes of thousands of 
      genes under the perturbation of a TF, but is unable to determine if the affected 
      genes are direct or indirect targets of the TF. Furthermore, both ChIP-X and 
      microarray methods produce a large number of false positives. Combining 
      microarray expression profiling and ChIP-X data allows more effective TFBS 
      analysis for studying the function of a TF. However, current web servers only 
      provide tools to analyze either ChIP-X or expression data, but not both. Here, we 
      present ChIP-Array, a web server that integrates ChIP-X and expression data from 
      human, mouse, yeast, fruit fly and Arabidopsis. This server will assist 
      biologists to detect direct and indirect target genes regulated by a TF of 
      interest and to aid in the functional characterization of the TF. ChIP-Array is 
      available at http://jjwanglab.hku.hk/ChIP-Array, with free access to academic 
      users.

LID - 10.1002/cppb.20014 [doi]
AB  - In multi-cellular organisms, gene expression is orchestrated by thousands of 
      transcription factors (TF). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing 
      (ChIP-seq) is a robust tool to investigate gene expression because this technique 
      profiles in vivo protein-DNA interaction at a genome-wide scale. Eight years 
      after the first ChIP-seq paper, there are limited reports of ChIP-seq experiments 
      in plants, especially for sequence-specific DNA binding TFs This lag greatly 
      prevents our understanding of transcriptional regulation in an entire kingdom. In 
      order to bridge the technical gap, we describe a ChIP-seq procedure that we have 
      successfully applied to dozens of sequence-specific DNA binding TFs. The basic 
      protocol includes procedures to isolate nuclei, sonicate chromatin, 
      immunoprecipitate TF-DNA complex, and recover ChIP-enriched DNA fragments. The 
      support protocol also describes practices to optimize library preparation by a 
      gel-free DNA size selection. Lastly, examples are given to optimize library 
      amplification using real-time PCR.

TI  - WRKY6 transcription factor modulates root potassium acquisition through promoting 
      expression of AKT1 in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1652-1667
LID - 10.1111/tpj.16703 [doi]
AB  - Potassium (K(+)), being an essential macronutrient in plants, plays a central 
      role in many aspects. Root growth is highly plastic and is affected by many 
      different abiotic stresses including nutrient deficiency. The Shaker-type K(+) 
      channel Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) K(+) Transporter 1 (AKT1) is 
      responsible for K(+) uptake under both low and high external K(+) conditions. 
      However, the upstream transcription factor of AKT1 is not clear. Here, we 
      demonstrated that the WRKY6 transcription factor modulates root growth to low 
      potassium (LK) stress in Arabidopsis. WRKY6 showed a quick response to LK stress 
      and also to many other abiotic stress treatments. The two wrky6 T-DNA insertion 
      mutants were highly sensitive to LK treatment, whose primary root lengths were 
      much shorter, less biomass and lower K(+) content in roots than those of 
      wild-type plants, while WRKY6-overexpression lines showed opposite phenotypes. A 
      further investigation showed that WRKY6 regulated the expression of the AKT1 gene 
      via directly binding to the W-box elements in its promoter through EMSA and 
      ChIP-qPCR assays. A dual luciferase reporter analysis further demonstrated that 
      WRKY6 enhanced the transcription of AKT1. Genetic analysis further revealed that 
      the overexpression of AKT1 greatly rescued the short root phenotype of the wrky6 
      mutant under LK stress, suggesting AKT1 is epistatic to WRKY6 in the control of 
      LK response. Further transcriptome profiling suggested that WRKY6 modulates LK 
      response through a complex regulatory network. Thus, this study unveils a 
      transcription factor that modulates root growth under potassium deficiency 
      conditions by affecting the potassium channel gene AKT1 expression.

TI  - ANAC087 transcription factor positively regulates age-dependent leaf senescence 
      through modulating the expression of multiple target genes in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 967-984
LID - 10.1111/jipb.13434 [doi]
AB  - Leaf senescence is the final stage of leaf development and appropriate onset and 
      progression of leaf senescence are critical for reproductive success and fitness. 
      Although great progress has been made in identifying key genes regulating leaf 
      senescence and elucidating the underlining mechanisms in the model plant 
      Arabidopsis, there is still a gap to understanding the complex regulatory 
      network. In this study, we discovered that Arabidopsis ANAC087 transcription 
      factor (TF) positively modulated leaf senescence. Expression of ANAC087 was 
      induced in senescing leaves and the encoded protein acted as a transcriptional 
      activator. Both constitutive and inducible overexpression lines of ANAC087 showed 
      earlier senescence than control plants, whereas T-DNA insertion mutation and 
      dominant repression of the ANAC087 delayed senescence rate. A quantitative 
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) profiling showed that 
      the expression of an array of senescence-associated genes was upregulated in 
      inducible ANAC087 overexpression plants including BFN1, NYE1, CEP1, RbohD, SAG13, 
      SAG15, and VPEs, which are involved in programmed cell death (PCD), chlorophyll 
      degradation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. In addition, 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) assays 
      demonstrated that ANAC087 directly bound to the canonical NAC recognition 
      sequence (NACRS) motif in promoters of its target genes. Moreover, mutation of 
      two representative target genes, BFN1 or NYE1 alleviated the senescence rate of 
      ANAC087-overexpression plants, suggesting their genetic regulatory relationship. 
      Taken together, this study indicates that ANAC087 serves as an important 
      regulator linking PCD, ROS, and chlorophyll degradation to leaf senescence.

AB  - Transcription factors play crucial roles in almost all physiological processes 
      including leaf senescence. Cell death is a typical symptom appearing in senescing 
      leaves, which is also classified as developmental programmed cell death (PCD). 
      However, the link between PCD and leaf senescence still remains unclear. Here, we 
      found a WRKY transcription factor WRKY47 positively modulates age-dependent leaf 
      senescence in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). WRKY47 was expressed 
      preferentially in senescing leaves. A subcellular localization assay indicated 
      that WRKY47 was exclusively localized in nuclei. Overexpression of WRKY47 showed 
      precocious leaf senescence, with less chlorophyll content and higher electrolyte 
      leakage, but loss-of-function mutants of WRKY47 delayed this biological process. 
      Through qRT-PCR and dual luciferase reporter assays, we found that WRKY47 could 
      activate the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and PCD-associated 
      genes to regulate leaf senescence. Furthermore, through electrophoretic mobility 
      shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR, WRKY47 was 
      found to bind to W-box fragments in promoter regions of BFN1 (Bifunctional 
      Nuclease 1) and MC6 (Metacaspase 6) directly. In general, our research revealed 
      that WRKY47 regulates age-dependent leaf senescence by activating the 
      transcription of two PCD-associated genes.

AB  - Steadily growing demands for identification and quantification of cellular 
      metabolites in higher throughput have brought a need for new analytical 
      technologies. Here, we developed a synthetic biological sensor system for 
      quantifying metabolites from biological cell samples. For this, bacterial 
      transcription factors were exploited, which bind to or dissociate from regulatory 
      DNA elements in response to physiological changes in the cellular metabolite 
      concentration range. Representatively, the bacterial pyruvate dehydrogenase 
      (PdhR), trehalose (TreR), and l-arginine (ArgR) repressor proteins were 
      functionalized to detect pyruvate, trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P), and arginine 
      concentration in solution. For each transcription factor the mutual binding 
      behavior between metabolite and DNA, their working range, and othogonality were 
      determined. High-throughput, parallel processing, and automation were achieved 
      through integration of the metabolic sensor system on a microfluidic large-scale 
      integration (mLSI) chip platform. To demonstrate the functionality of the 
      integrated metabolic sensor system, we measured diurnal concentration changes of 
      pyruvate and the plant signaling molecule T6P within cell etxracts of Arabidopsis 
      thaliana rosettes. The transcription factor sensor system is of generic nature 
      and extendable on the microfluidic chip.

PG  - 878418

LID - 878418
AB  - The widespread deficiency of iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) is becoming a global 
      concern. The underlying mechanisms regulating Fe and S sensing and signaling have 
      not been well understood. We investigated the crosstalk between Fe and S using 
      mutants impaired in Fe homeostasis, sulfate assimilation, and glutathione (GSH) 
      biosynthesis. We showed that chlorosis symptoms induced by Fe deficiency were not 
      directly related to the endogenous GSH levels. We found dynamic crosstalk between 
      Fe and S networks and more interestingly observed that the upregulated expression 
      of IRT1 and FRO2 under S deficiency in Col-0 was missing in the cad2-1 mutant 
      background, which suggests that under S deficiency, the expression of IRT1 and 
      FRO2 was directly or indirectly dependent on GSH. Interestingly, the bottleneck 
      in sulfite reduction led to a constitutively higher IRT1 expression in the sir1-1 
      mutant. While the high-affinity sulfate transporter (Sultr1;2) was upregulated 
      under Fe deficiency in the roots, the low-affinity sulfate transporters 
      (Sultr2;1, and Sultr2;2) were down-regulated in the shoots of Col-0 seedlings. 
      Moreover, the expression analysis of some of the key players in the Fe-S cluster 
      assembly revealed that the expression of the so-called Fe donor in mitochondria 
      (AtFH) and S mobilizer of group II cysteine desulfurase in plastids (AtNFS2) were 
      upregulated under Fe deficiency in Col-0. Our qPCR data and ChIP-qPCR experiments 
      suggested that the expression of AtFH is likely under the transcriptional 
      regulation of the central transcription factor FIT.

AB  - The current status of lignocellulosic biomass as an invaluable resource in 
      industry, agriculture, and health has spurred increased interest in understanding 
      the transcriptional regulation of secondary cell wall (SCW) biosynthesis. The 
      last decade of research has revealed an extensive network of NAC, MYB and other 
      families of transcription factors regulating Arabidopsis SCW biosynthesis, and 
      numerous studies have explored SCW-related transcription factors in other dicots 
      and monocots. Whilst the general structure of the Arabidopsis network has been a 
      topic of several reviews, they have not comprehensively represented the detailed 
      protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions described in the literature, and an 
      understanding of network dynamics and functionality has not yet been achieved for 
      SCW formation. Furthermore the methodologies employed in studies of SCW 
      transcriptional regulation have not received much attention, especially in the 
      case of non-model organisms. In this review, we have reconstructed the most 
      exhaustive literature-based network representations to date of SCW 
      transcriptional regulation in Arabidopsis. We include a manipulable Cytoscape 
      representation of the Arabidopsis SCW transcriptional network to aid in future 
      studies, along with a list of supporting literature for each documented 
      interaction. Amongst other topics, we discuss the various components of the 
      network, its evolutionary conservation in plants, putative modules and dynamic 
      mechanisms that may influence network function, and the approaches that have been 
      employed in network inference. Future research should aim to better understand 
      network function and its response to dynamic perturbations, whilst the 
      development and application of genome-wide approaches such as ChIP-seq and 
      systems genetics are in progress for the study of SCW transcriptional regulation 
      in non-model organisms.

TI  - The iron deficiency response in Arabidopsis thaliana requires the phosphorylated 
      transcription factor URI.

AB  - Iron is an essential nutrient for plants, but excess iron is toxic due to its 
      catalytic role in the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Thus, iron uptake is highly 
      regulated and induced only under iron deficiency. The mechanisms of iron uptake 
      in roots are well characterized, but less is known about how plants perceive iron 
      deficiency. We show that a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor 
      Upstream Regulator of IRT1 (URI) acts as an essential part of the iron deficiency 
      signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana The uri mutant is defective in inducing 
      Iron-Regulated Transporter1 (IRT1) and Ferric Reduction Oxidase2 (FRO2) and their 
      transcriptional regulators FER-like iron deficiency-induced transcription factor 
      (FIT) and bHLH38/39/100/101 in response to iron deficiency. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) reveals direct binding of 
      URI to promoters of many iron-regulated genes, including bHLH38/39/100/101 but 
      not FIT While URI transcript and protein are expressed regardless of iron status, 
      a phosphorylated form of URI only accumulates under iron deficiency. 
      Phosphorylated URI is subject to proteasome-dependent degradation during iron 
      resupply, and turnover of phosphorylated URI is dependent on the E3 ligase BTS. 
      The subgroup IVc bHLH transcription factors, which have previously been shown to 
      regulate bHLH38/39/100/101, coimmunoprecipitate with URI mainly under 
      Fe-deficient conditions, suggesting that it is the phosphorylated form of URI 
      that is capable of forming heterodimers in vivo. We propose that the 
      phosphorylated form of URI accumulates under Fe deficiency, forms heterodimers 
      with subgroup IVc proteins, and induces transcription of bHLH38/39/100/101 These 
      transcription factors in turn heterodimerize with FIT and drive the transcription 
      of IRT1 and FRO2 to increase Fe uptake.

LID - 10.1093/nar/gky1128 [doi]
AB  - The current version of the Gene Transcription Regulation Database (GTRD; 
      http://gtrd.biouml.org) contains information about: (i) transcription factor 
      binding sites (TFBSs) and transcription coactivators identified by ChIP-seq 
      experiments for Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Danio rerio, 
      Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Arabidopsis thaliana; (ii) regions of open 
      chromatin and TFBSs (DNase footprints) identified by DNase-seq; (iii) unmappable 
      regions where TFBSs cannot be identified due to repeats; (iv) potential TFBSs for 
      both human and mouse using position weight matrices from the HOCOMOCO database. 
      Raw ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data were obtained from ENCODE and SRA, and uniformly 
      processed. ChIP-seq peaks were called using four different methods: MACS, SISSRs, 
      GEM and PICS. Moreover, peaks for the same factor and peak calling method, albeit 
      using different experiment conditions (cell line, treatment, etc.), were merged 
      into clusters. To reduce noise, such clusters for different peak calling methods 
      were merged into meta-clusters; these were considered to be non-redundant TFBS 
      sets. Moreover, extended quality control was applied to all ChIP-seq data. Web 
      interface to access GTRD was developed using the BioUML platform. It provides 
      browsing and displaying information, advanced search possibilities and an 
      integrated genome browser.

TI  - ATAF1 transcription factor directly regulates abscisic acid biosynthetic gene 
      NCED3 in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 321-7
LID - 10.1016/j.fob.2013.07.006 [doi]
AB  - ATAF1, an Arabidopsis thaliana NAC transcription factor, plays important roles in 
      plant adaptation to environmental stress and development. To search for ATAF1 
      target genes, we used protein binding microarrays and 
      chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP). This identified T[A,C,G]CGT[A,G] and 
      TT[A,C,G]CGT as ATAF1 consensus binding sequences. Co-expression analysis across 
      publicly available microarray experiments identified 25 genes co-expressed with 
      ATAF1. The promoter regions of ATAF1 co-expressors were significantly enriched 
      for ATAF1 binding sites, and TTGCGTA was identified in the promoter of the key 
      abscisic acid (ABA) phytohormone biosynthetic gene NCED3. ChIP-qPCR and 
      expression analysis showed that ATAF1 binding to the NCED3 promoter correlated 
      with increased NCED3 expression and ABA hormone levels. These results indicate 
      that ATAF1 regulates ABA biosynthesis.

TI  - Coordination of Chloroplast Development through the Action of the GNC and GLK 
      Transcription Factor Families.
PG  - 130-147
LID - 10.1104/pp.18.00414 [doi]
AB  - Fundamental questions regarding how chloroplasts develop from proplastids remain 
      poorly understood despite their central importance to plant life. Two families of 
      nuclear transcription factors, the GATA NITRATE-INDUCIBLE 
      CARBON-METABOLISM-INVOLVED (GNC) and GOLDEN TWO-LIKE (GLK) families, have been 
      implicated in directly and positively regulating chloroplast development. Here, 
      we determined the degree of functional overlap between the two transcription 
      factor families in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), characterizing their 
      ability to regulate chloroplast biogenesis both alone and in concert. We 
      determined the DNA-binding motifs for GNC and GLK2 using protein-binding 
      microarrays; the enrichment of these motifs in transcriptome datasets indicates 
      that GNC and GLK2 are repressors and activators of gene expression, respectively. 
      ChIP-seq analysis of GNC identified PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR and 
      brassinosteroid activity genes as targets whose repression by GNC facilitates 
      chloroplast biogenesis. In addition, GNC targets and represses genes involved in 
      ERECTA signaling and thereby facilitates stomatal development. Our results define 
      key regulatory features of the GNC and GLK transcription factor families that 
      contribute to the control of chloroplast biogenesis and photosynthetic activity, 
      including areas of independence and cross talk.

AB  - Dioecy system is an important strategy for maintaining genetic diversity. The 
      transcription factor MeGI, contributes to dioecy by promoting gynoecium 
      development in Diospyros lotus and D. kaki. However, the function of MeGI in D. 
      oleifera has not been identified. In this study, we confirmed that MeGI, cloned 
      from D. oleifera, repressed the androecium development in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
      Subsequently, chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq), DNA affinity 
      purification-sequencing (DAP-seq), and RNA-seq were used to uncover the gene 
      expression response to MeGI. The results showed that the genes upregulated and 
      downregulated in response to MeGI were mainly enriched in the circadian 
      rhythm-related and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, respectively. Additionally, 
      the WRKY DNA-binding protein 28 (WRKY28) gene, which was detected by ChIP-seq, 
      DAP-seq, and RNA-seq, was emphasized. WRKY28 has been reported to inhibit 
      salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis and was upregulated in MeGI-overexpressing A. 
      thaliana flowers, suggesting that MeGI represses the SA level by increasing the 
      expression level of WRKY28. This was confirmed that SA level was lower in D. 
      oleifera female floral buds than male. Overall, our findings indicate that the 
      MeGI mediates its sex control function in D. oleifera mainly by regulating genes 
      in the circadian rhythm, SA biosynthetic, and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways.

TI  - Role of a ZF-HD Transcription Factor in miR157-Mediated Feed-Forward Regulatory 
      Module That Determines Plant Architecture in Arabidopsis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158665 [doi]
LID - 8665
AB  - In plants, vegetative and reproductive development are associated with 
      agronomically important traits that contribute to grain yield and biomass. Zinc 
      finger homeodomain (ZF-HD) transcription factors (TFs) constitute a relatively 
      small gene family that has been studied in several model plants, including 
      Arabidopsis thaliana L. and Oryza sativa L. The ZF-HD family members play 
      important roles in plant growth and development, but their contribution to the 
      regulation of plant architecture remains largely unknown due to their functional 
      redundancy. To understand the gene regulatory network controlled by ZF-HD TFs, we 
      analyzed multiple loss-of-function mutants of ZF-HD TFs in Arabidopsis that 
      exhibited morphological abnormalities in branching and flowering architecture. We 
      found that ZF-HD TFs, especially HB34, negatively regulate the expression of 
      miR157 and positively regulate SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE 10 (SPL10), a 
      target of miR157. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) 
      analysis revealed that miR157D and SPL10 are direct targets of HB34, creating a 
      feed-forward loop that constitutes a robust miRNA regulatory module. Network 
      motif analysis contains overrepresented coherent type IV feedforward motifs in 
      the amiR zf-HD and hbq mutant background. This finding indicates that 
      miRNA-mediated ZF-HD feedforward modules modify branching and inflorescence 
      architecture in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these findings reveal a guiding role 
      of ZF-HD TFs in the regulatory network module and demonstrate its role in plant 
      architecture in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Glutathione (GSH) plays a fundamental role in plant defense. Recent reports 
      showed that enhanced GSH content activates mitogen-activated protein kinases 
      (MPKs). However, the molecular mechanism behind this GSH-mediated MPKs expression 
      during environmental challenges is unexplored. Here, we found that under control 
      and combined abiotic stress-treated conditions, GSH feeding activates MPK3 
      expression in Arabidopsis thaliana by inducing its promoter, as established 
      through the promoter activation assay. Additionally, transgenic A. thaliana 
      overexpressing the LeMPK3 gene (AtMPK3 line) showed increased γ-ECS expression, 
      which was decreased in mpk3, the MPK3-depleted mutant. An in-gel kinase assay 
      exhibited hyperphosphorylation of Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) in the GSH-fed 
      AtMPK3 transgenic line. Under control and combined abiotic stress treated 
      conditions, expression of transcription factor WRKY40 binding to MPK3 promoter 
      was up-regulated under enhanced GSH condition. Interestingly, GSH feeding was 
      rendered ineffective in altering MPK3 expression in the Atwrky40 mutant, 
      emphasizing the involvement of WRKY40 in GSH-MPK3 interplay. This was further 
      confirmed by a wrky40 co-transformation assay. The immunoprecipitation assay 
      followed by ChIP-qPCR showed a significant increase in the binding of WRKY40 to 
      MPK3 promoter, which further established MPK3-WRKY40 association upon GSH 
      feeding. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that GSH modulates MPK3 
      expression via WRKY40 in response to stress.

AB  - Plant growth and adaptation to environmental fluctuations involve a tight control 
      of cellular processes which, to a great extent, are mediated by changes at the 
      transcriptional level. This regulation is exerted by transcription factors (TFs), 
      a group of regulatory proteins that control gene expression by directly binding 
      to the gene promoter regions via their cognate TF-binding sites (TFBS). The 
      nature of TFBS defines the pattern of expression of the various plant loci, the 
      precise combinatorial assembly of these elements being key in conferring plant's 
      adaptation ability and in domestication. As such, TFs are main potential targets 
      for biotechnological interventions, prompting in the last decade notable 
      protein-DNA interaction efforts toward definition of their TFBS. Distinct methods 
      based on in vivo or in vitro approaches defined the TFBS for many TFs, mainly in 
      Arabidopsis, but comprehensive information on the transcriptional networks for 
      many regulators is still lacking, especially in crops. In this chapter, detailed 
      protocols for DAP-seq studies to unbiased identification of TFBS in potato are 
      provided. This methodology relies on the affinity purification of genomic 
      DNA-protein complexes in vitro, and high-throughput sequencing of the eluted DNA 
      fragments. DAP-seq outperforms other in vitro DNA-motif definition strategies, 
      such as protein-binding microarrays and SELEX-seq, since the protein of interest 
      is directly bound to the genomic DNA extracted from plants yielding all the 
      potential sites bound by the TF in the genome. Actually, data generated from 
      DAP-seq experiments are highly similar to those out of ChIP-seq methods, but are 
      generated much faster. We also provide a standard procedure to the analysis of 
      the DAP-seq data, addressed to non-experienced users, that involves two 
      consecutive steps: (1) processing of raw data (trimming, filtering, and read 
      alignment) and (2) peak calling and identification of enriched motifs. This 
      method allows identification of the binding profiles of dozens of TFs in crops, 
      in a timely manner.

TI  - The bHLH transcription factor POPEYE regulates response to iron deficiency in 
      Arabidopsis roots.
PG  - 2219-36
LID - 10.1105/tpc.110.074096 [doi]
AB  - Global population increases and climate change underscore the need for better 
      comprehension of how plants acquire and process nutrients such as iron. Using 
      cell type-specific transcriptional profiling, we identified a pericycle-specific 
      iron deficiency response and a bHLH transcription factor, POPEYE (PYE), that may 
      play an important role in this response. Functional analysis of PYE suggests that 
      it positively regulates growth and development under iron-deficient conditions. 
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip analysis and transcriptional profiling 
      reveal that PYE helps maintain iron homeostasis by regulating the expression of 
      known iron homeostasis genes and other genes involved in transcription, 
      development, and stress response. PYE interacts with PYE homologs, including 
      IAA-Leu Resistant3 (ILR3), another bHLH transcription factor that is involved in 
      metal ion homeostasis. Moreover, ILR3 interacts with a third protein, BRUTUS 
      (BTS), a putative E3 ligase protein, with metal ion binding and DNA binding 
      domains, which negatively regulates the response to iron deficiency. PYE and BTS 
      expression is also tightly coregulated. We propose that interactions among PYE, 
      PYE homologs, and BTS are important for maintaining iron homeostasis under low 
      iron conditions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Transcription factors (TFs) and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) 
      control gene transcripts involved in various biological processes. We hypothesize 
      that TFs and CREs can be effective molecular tools for De Novo regulation designs 
      to engineer plants. OBJECTIVES: We selected two Arabidopsis TF types and two 
      tobacco CRE types to design a De Novo regulation and evaluated its effectiveness 
      in plant engineering. METHODS: G-box and MYB recognition elements (MREs) were 
      identified in four Nicotiana tabacum JAZs (NtJAZs) promoters. MRE-like and G-box 
      like elements were identified in one nicotine pathway gene promoter. TF screening 
      led to select Arabidopsis Production of Anthocyanin Pigment 1 (PAP1/MYB) and 
      Transparent Testa 8 (TT8/bHLH). Two NtJAZ and two nicotine pathway gene promoters 
      were cloned from commercial Narrow Leaf Madole (NL) and KY171 (KY) tobacco 
      cultivars. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), cross-linked chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and dual-luciferase assays were performed to test the 
      promoter binding and activation by PAP1 (P), TT8 (T), PAP1/TT8 together, and the 
      PAP1/TT8/Transparent Testa Glabra 1 (TTG1) complex. A DNA cassette was designed 
      and then synthesized for stacking and expressing PAP1 and TT8 together. Three 
      years of field trials were performed by following industrial and GMO protocols. 
      Gene expression and metabolic profiling were completed to characterize plant 
      secondary metabolism. RESULTS: PAP1, TT8, PAP1/TT8, and the PAP1/TT8/TTG1 complex 
      bound to and activated NtJAZ promoters but did not bind to nicotine pathway gene 
      promoters. The engineered red P + T plants significantly upregulated four NtJAZs 
      but downregulated the tobacco alkaloid biosynthesis. Field trials showed 
      significant reduction of five tobacco alkaloids and four carcinogenic tobacco 
      specific nitrosamines in most or all cured leaves of engineered P + T and PAP1 
      genotypes. CONCLUSION: G-boxes, MREs, and two TF types are appropriate molecular 
      tools for a De Novo regulation design to create a novel distant-pathway cross 
      regulation for altering plant secondary metabolism.

TI  - A plasma membrane-tethered transcription factor, NAC062/ANAC062/NTL6, mediates 
      the unfolded protein response in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1033-43
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12604 [doi]
AB  - The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum 
      (ER) triggers a well conserved pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR) 
      in eukaryotic cells to mitigate ER stress. Two signaling pathways, S2P-bZIP28 and 
      IRE1-bZIP60, play important roles in transmitting ER stress signals from the ER 
      to the nucleus in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). It is not known whether 
      other components in the secretory pathway also contribute to the alleviation of 
      ER stress. Here we report the identification of a plasma membrane-associated 
      transcription factor, NAC062 (also known as ANAC062/NTL6), as another important 
      UPR mediator in Arabidopsis plants. NAC062 relocates from the plasma membrane to 
      the nucleus and regulates the expression of ER stress responsive genes in 
      Arabidopsis. Knock-down of NAC062 in the wild-type background confers ER stress 
      sensitivity, while inducible expression of a nucleus-localized form of NAC062, 
      NAC062D, in the bZIP28 and bZIP60 double mutant (zip28zip60) background increases 
      ER stress tolerance. Knock-down of NAC062 impairs ER-stress-induced expression of 
      UPR downstream genes while over-expression of NAC062D-MYC induces the expression 
      of UPR downstream genes under normal growth condition. CHIP-qPCR reveals that 
      NAC062D-MYC is enriched at the promoter regions of several UPR downstream genes 
      such as BiP2. Furthermore, NAC062 itself is also up-regulated by ER stress, which 
      is dependent on bZIP60 but not on bZIP28. Thus, our results have uncovered an 
      alternative UPR pathway in plants in which the membrane-associated transcription 
      factor NAC062 relays ER stress signaling from the plasma membrane to the nucleus 
      and plays important roles in regulating UPR downstream gene expression.

TI  - Kiwifruit SVP2 controls developmental and drought-stress pathways.
PG  - 233-244
LID - 10.1007/s11103-017-0688-3 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide targets of Actinidia chinensis SVP2 confirm roles in ABA- and 
      dehydration-mediated growth repression and reveal a conservation in mechanism of 
      action between SVP genes of taxonomically distant Arabidopsis and a woody 
      perennial kiwifruit. The molecular mechanisms underlying growth and dormancy in 
      woody perennials are largely unknown. In Arabidopsis, the MADS-box transcription 
      factor SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) plays a key role in the progression from 
      vegetative to floral development, and in woody perennials SVP-like genes are also 
      proposed to be involved in controlling dormancy. During kiwifruit development 
      SVP2 has a role in growth inhibition, with high-chill kiwifruit Actinidia 
      deliciosa transgenic lines overexpressing SVP2 showing suppressed bud outgrowth. 
      Transcriptomic analyses of these plants suggests that SVP2 mimics the 
      well-documented abscisic acid (ABA) effect on the plant dehydration response. To 
      corroborate the growth inhibition role of SVP2 in kiwifruit development at the 
      molecular level, we analysed the genome-wide direct targets of SVP2 using 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing in kiwifruit 
      A. chinensis. SVP2 was found to bind to at least 297 target sites in the 
      kiwifruit genome, and potentially modulates 252 genes that function in a range of 
      biological processes, especially those involved in repressing meristem activity 
      and ABA-mediated dehydration pathways. In addition, our ChIP-seq analysis reveals 
      remarkable conservation in mechanism of action between SVP genes of taxonomically 
      distant plant species.

TI  - Genome-wide data (ChIP-seq) enabled identification of cell wall-related and 
      aquaporin genes as targets of tomato ASR1, a drought stress-responsive 
      transcription factor.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/1471-2229-14-29 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying the target genes of transcription factors is important 
      for unraveling regulatory networks in all types of organisms. Our interest was 
      precisely to uncover the spectrum of loci regulated by a widespread plant 
      transcription factor involved in physiological adaptation to drought, a type of 
      stress that plants have encountered since the colonization of land habitats 400 
      MYA. The regulator under study, named ASR1, is exclusive to the plant kingdom 
      (albeit absent in Arabidopsis) and known to alleviate the stress caused by 
      restricted water availability. As its target genes are still unknown despite the 
      original cloning of Asr1 cDNA 20 years ago, we examined the tomato genome for 
      specific loci interacting in vivo with this conspicuous protein. RESULTS: We 
      performed ChIP followed by high throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) on leaves 
      from stressed tomato plants, using a high-quality anti-ASR1 antibody. In this 
      way, we unraveled a novel repertoire of target genes, some of which are clearly 
      involved in the response to drought stress. Many of the ASR1-enriched genomic 
      loci we found encode enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis and remodeling as 
      well as channels implicated in water and solute flux, such as aquaporins. In 
      addition, we were able to determine a robust consensus ASR1-binding DNA motif. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The finding of cell wall synthesis and aquaporin genes as targets of 
      ASR1 is consistent with their suggested role in the physiological adaptation of 
      plants to water loss. The results gain insight into the environmental 
      stress-sensing pathways leading to plant tolerance of drought.

TI  - Building a Robust Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Method with Substantially 
      Improved Efficiency.
PG  - 1026-1034
LID - 10.1104/pp.20.00392 [doi]
AB  - Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the gold-standard method for detection of 
      interactions between proteins and chromatin and is a powerful tool for 
      identification of epigenetic modifications. Although ChIP protocols for plant 
      species have been developed, many specific features of plants, especially woody 
      plants, still hinder the efficiency of immunoprecipitation, resulting in 
      inefficient ChIP enrichment and an active demand for a highly efficient ChIP 
      protocol. In this study, using birch (Betula platyphylla) and Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) as the research materials, we identified five factors 
      closely associated with ChIP efficiency, including crosslinking, concentration of 
      chromatin using centrifugal filters, use of a different immunoprecipitation 
      buffer, rescue of DNA with proteinase K, and use of Suc to increase 
      immunoprecipitation efficiency. Optimization of any these factors can 
      significantly improve ChIP efficiency. Considering these factors together, we 
      developed a robust ChIP protocol that achieved a 14-fold improvement in ChIP 
      enrichment for birch and a >6-fold improvement for Arabidopsis compared to the 
      standard ChIP method. As this ChIP method works well in both birch and 
      Arabidopsis, it should also be suitable for other woody and herbaceous species. 
      In addition, this ChIP method enables detection of low-abundance transcription 
      factor-DNA interactions and may extend the application of ChIP in the plant 
      kingdom.

TI  - The transcription factor ThDOF8 binds to a novel cis-element and mediates 
      molecular responses to salt stress in Tamarix hispida.
PG  - 3171-3187
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erae070 [doi]
AB  - Salt stress is a common abiotic factor that restricts plant growth and 
      development. As a halophyte, Tamarix hispida is a good model plant for exploring 
      salt-tolerance genes and regulatory mechanisms. DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) 
      is an important transcription factor (TF) that influences and controls various 
      signaling substances involved in diverse biological processes related to plant 
      growth and development, but the regulatory mechanisms of DOF TFs in response to 
      salt stress are largely unknown in T. hispida. In the present study, a newly 
      identified Dof gene, ThDOF8, was cloned from T. hispida, and its expression was 
      found to be induced by salt stress. Transient overexpression of ThDOF8 enhanced 
      T. hispida salt tolerance by enhancing proline levels, and increasing the 
      activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase 
      (POD). These results were also verified in stably transformed Arabidopsis. 
      Results from TF-centered yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays and EMSAs showed that 
      ThDOF8 binds to a newly identified cis-element (TGCG). Expression profiling by 
      gene chip analysis identified four potential direct targets of ThDOF8, namely the 
      cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases genes, CRK10 and CRK26, and two glutamate 
      decarboxylase genes, GAD41, and GAD42, and these were further verified by 
      ChIP-quantitative-PCR, EMSAs, Y1H assays, and β-glucuronidase enzyme activity 
      assays. ThDOF8 can bind to the TGCG element in the promoter regions of its target 
      genes, and transient overexpression of ThCRK10 also enhanced T. hispida salt 
      tolerance. On the basis of our results, we propose a new regulatory mechanism 
      model, in which ThDOF8 binds to the TGCG cis-element in the promoter of the 
      target gene CRK10 to regulate its expression and improve salt tolerance in T. 
      hispida. This study provides a basis for furthering our understanding the role of 
      DOF TFs and identifying other downstream candidate genes that have the potential 
      for improving plant salt tolerance via molecular breeding.

PG  - 580-6
LID - 10.1016/j.pbi.2009.07.006 [doi]
AB  - Floral repressors ensure correct reproductive timing by safeguarding against 
      premature flowering. In the past decade, several mechanisms of floral repression 
      have come to light. Discrimination between direct and indirect repressors has 
      been facilitated by increasing the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. 
      Certain MADS-domain transcription factors such as SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE and 
      FLOWERING LOCUS C bind directly to target euchromatin to repress specific loci 
      including FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and FD. The AP2-domain transcription factor 
      TEMPRANILLO 1 has also been shown to directly repress FT by binding its 5' UTR. 
      We highlight emerging systems level approaches, including genome-scale direct 
      binding studies (ChIP-chip and ChIP-Seq), which stand out in their promise to 
      elucidate the complex network underlying the transition to flowering at an 
      unprecedented level.

TI  - ChIPseqR: analysis of ChIP-seq experiments.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-12-39 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of high-throughput sequencing in combination with chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) has enabled the study of genome-wide protein 
      binding at high resolution. While the amount of data generated from such 
      experiments is steadily increasing, the methods available for their analysis 
      remain limited. Although several algorithms for the analysis of ChIP-seq data 
      have been published they focus almost exclusively on transcription factor studies 
      and are usually not well suited for the analysis of other types of experiments. 
      RESULTS: Here we present ChIPseqR, an algorithm for the analysis of nucleosome 
      positioning and histone modification ChIP-seq experiments. The performance of 
      this novel method is studied on short read sequencing data of Arabidopsis 
      thaliana mononucleosomes as well as on simulated data. CONCLUSIONS: ChIPseqR is 
      shown to improve sensitivity and spatial resolution over existing methods while 
      maintaining high specificity. Further analysis of predicted nucleosomes reveals 
      characteristic patterns in nucleosome sequences and placement.

TI  - AtHAP5A regulates iron translocation in iron-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 1910-1925
LID - 10.1111/jipb.12984 [doi]
AB  - Iron (Fe) deficient plants employ multiple strategies to increase root uptake and 
      root-to-shoot translocation of Fe. The identification of genes that are 
      responsible for these processes, and a comprehensive understanding of the 
      regulatory effects of transcriptional networks on their expression, including 
      transcription factors (TFs), is underway in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we show 
      that a Histone- or heme-associated proteins (HAP) transcription factor (TF), 
      HAP5A, is necessary for the response to Fe deficiency in Arabidopsis. Its 
      expression was induced under Fe deficiency, and the lack of HAP5A significantly 
      decreased Fe translocation from the root to the shoot, resulting in substantial 
      chlorosis of the newly expanded leaves, compared with the wild-type (WT, Col-0). 
      Further analysis found that the expression of a gene encoding nicotianamine (NA) 
      synthase (NAS1) was dramatically decreased in the hap5a mutant, regardless of the 
      Fe status. Yeast-one-hybrid and ChIP analyses suggested that HAP5A directly binds 
      to the promoter region of NAS1. Moreover, overexpression of NAS1 could rescue the 
      chlorosis phenotype of hap5a in Fe deficient conditions. In summary, a novel 
      pathway was elucidated, showing that NAS1-dependent translocation of Fe from the 
      root to the shoot is controlled by HAP5A in Fe-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana.

TI  - Cuticular wax biosynthesis is positively regulated by WRINKLED4, an AP2/ERF-type 
      transcription factor, in Arabidopsis stems.
PG  - 257-270
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13248 [doi]
AB  - The aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants are covered by a cuticular wax layer, 
      which protects the plants from environmental stresses such as desiccation, high 
      irradiance, and UV radiation. Cuticular wax deposition is regulated in an 
      organ-specific manner; Arabidopsis stems have more than 10-fold higher wax loads 
      than leaves. In this study, we found that WRINKLED4 (WRI4), encoding an AP2/ERF 
      (ethylene-responsive factor) transcription factor (TF), is predominantly 
      expressed in stem epidermis, is upregulated by salt stress, and is involved in 
      activating cuticular wax biosynthesis in Arabidopsis stems. WRI4 harbors a 
      transcriptional activation domain at its N-terminus, and fluorescent signals from 
      a WRI4:eYFP construct were localized to the nuclei of tobacco leaf protoplasts. 
      Deposition of epicuticular wax crystals on stems was reduced in wri4-1 and wri4-3 
      knockout mutants. Total wax loads were reduced by ~28% in wri4 stems but were not 
      altered in wri4 siliques or leaves compared to the wild type. The levels of 
      29-carbon long alkanes, ketones, and secondary alcohols, which are the most 
      abundant components of stem waxes, were significantly reduced in wri4 stems 
      relative to the wild type. A transactivation assay in tobacco protoplasts and a 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that the expression of 
      long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase1 (LACS1), β-ketoacyl CoA reductase1 (KCR1), 
      PASTICCINO2 (PAS2), trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase (ECR), and bifunctional wax 
      synthase/acyl-CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WSD1) is positively regulated 
      by direct binding of WRI4 to their promoters. Taken together, these results 
      suggest that WRI4 is a transcriptional activator that specifically controls 
      cuticular wax biosynthesis in Arabidopsis stems.

TI  - Investigation of the effect of UV-B light on Arabidopsis MYB4 (AtMYB4) 
      transcription factor stability and detection of a putative MYB4-binding motif in

AB  - Here, we have investigated the possible effect of UV-B light on the 
      folding/unfolding properties and stability of Arabidopsis thaliana MYB4 (AtMYB4) 
      transcription factor in vitro by using biophysical approaches. Urea-induced 
      equilibrium unfolding analyses have shown relatively higher stability of the 
      wild-type recombinant AtMYB4 protein than the N-terminal deletion forms after 
      UV-B exposure. However, as compared to wild-type form, AtMYB4Δ2 protein, lacking 
      both the two N-terminal MYB domains, showed appreciable alteration in the 
      secondary structure following UV-B exposure. UV-B irradiated AtMYB4Δ2 also 
      displayed higher propensity of aggregation in light scattering experiments, 
      indicating importance of the N-terminal modules in regulating the stability of 
      AtMYB4 under UV-B stress. DNA binding assays have indicated specific binding 
      activity of AtMYB4 to a putative MYB4 binding motif located about 212 bp upstream 
      relative to transcription start site of AtMYB4 gene promoter, while relatively 
      weak DNA binding activity was detected for another putative MYB4 motif located at 
      -908 bp in AtMYB4 promoter. Gel shift and fluorescence anisotropy studies have 
      shown increased binding affinity of UV-B exposed AtMYB4 to the promoter proximal 
      MYB4 motif. ChIP assay has revealed binding of AtMYB4 to the promoter proximal 
      (-212 position) MYB4 motif (ACCAAAC) in vivo. Docking experiments further 
      revealed mechanistic detail of AtMYB4 interaction with the putative binding 
      motifs. Overall, our results have indicated that the N-terminal 62-116 amino acid 
      residues constituting the second MYB domain plays an important role in 
      maintaining the stability of the C-terminal region and the overall stability of 
      the protein, while a promoter proximal MYB-motif in AtMYB4 promoter may involve 
      in the regulation of its own expression under UV-B light.

TI  - Warm Temperature Promotes Shoot Regeneration in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 618-634
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcac017 [doi]
AB  - Many plants are able to regenerate upon cutting, and this process can be enhanced 
      in vitro by incubating explants on hormone-supplemented media. While such 
      protocols have been used for decades, little is known about the molecular details 
      of how incubation conditions influence their efficiency. In this study, we find 
      that warm temperature promotes both callus formation and shoot regeneration in 
      Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that such an increase in shoot regenerative 
      capacity at higher temperatures correlates with the enhanced expression of 
      several regeneration-associated genes, such as CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 1 (CUC1) 
      encoding a transcription factor involved in shoot meristem formation and YUCCAs 
      (YUCs) encoding auxin biosynthesis enzymes. ChIP-sequencing analyses further 
      reveal that histone variant H2A.Z is enriched on these loci at 17°C, while its 
      occupancy is reduced by an increase in ambient temperature to 27°C. Moreover, we 
      provide genetic evidence to demonstrate that H2A.Z acts as a repressor of de novo 
      shoot organogenesis since H2A.Z-depleted mutants display enhanced shoot 
      regeneration. This study thus uncovers a new chromatin-based mechanism that 
      influences hormone-induced regeneration and additionally highlights incubation 
      temperature as a key parameter for optimizing in vitro tissue culture.

AB  - Plant flowering is crucial for the onset and progression of reproduction 
      processes. The control of flowering time is a sophisticated system with multiple 
      known regulatory mechanisms in plants. Here, we show that MYB117 participates in 
      the flowering time regulation in Arabidopsis as myb117 mutants exhibited early 
      flowering phenotypes under long-day condition. Transcriptome analysis of myb117 
      mutants revealed 410 differentially expressed genes between wild type and 
      myb117-1 mutants, where selective genes including the Flowering Locus T (FT) were 
      further confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Further, in vivo dual-luciferase and 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) assays showed that 
      MYB117 directly binds to the promoter of FT to suppress its expression. Taken 
      together, we have revealed the transcriptome profile of myb117 mutants and 
      identified MYB117 as a negative regulator in controlling flowering time through 
      regulating the expression of FT in Arabidopsis.

TI  - PIF4 Promotes Expression of HSFA2 to Enhance Basal Thermotolerance in 
      Arabidopsis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23116017 [doi]
LID - 6017
AB  - Heat stress (HS) seriously restricts the growth and development of plants. When 
      plants are exposed to extreme high temperature, the heat stress response (HSR) is 
      activated to enable plants to survive. Sessile plants have evolved multiple 
      strategies to sense and cope with HS. Previous studies have established that 
      PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) acts as a key component in 
      thermomorphogenesis; however, whether PIF4 regulates plant thermotolerance and 
      the molecular mechanism linking this light transcriptional factor and HSR remain 
      unclear. Here, we show that the overexpression of PIF4 indeed provides plants 
      with a stronger basal thermotolerance and greatly improves the survival ability 
      of Arabidopsis under severe HS. Via phylogenetic analysis, we identified two sets 
      (six) of PIF4 homologs in wheat, and the expression patterns of the PIF4 homologs 
      were conservatively induced by heat treatment in both wheat and Arabidopsis. 
      Furthermore, the PIF4 protein was accumulated under heat stress and had an 
      identical expression level. Additionally, we found that the core regulator of 
      HSR, HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 (HSFA2), was highly responsive to light 
      and heat. Followed by promoter analysis and ChIP-qPCR, we further found that PIF4 
      can bind directly to the G-box motifs of the HSFA2 promoter. Via 
      effector-reporter assays, we found that PIF4 binding could activate HSFA2 gene 
      expression, thereby resulting in the activation of other HS-inducible genes, such 
      as heat shock proteins. Finally, the overexpression of PIF4 led to a stronger 
      basal thermotolerance under non-heat-treatment conditions, thereby resulting in 
      an enhanced tolerance to severe heat stress. Taken together, our findings propose 
      that PIF4 is linked to heat stress signaling by directly binding to the HSFA2 
      promoter and triggering the HSR at normal temperature conditions to promote the 
      basal thermotolerance. These functions of PIF4 provide a candidate direction for 
      breeding heat-resistant crop cultivars.

AB  - The identification of transcription factor (TF) target genes is central in 
      biology. A popular approach is based on the location by pattern matching of 
      potential cis-regulatory elements (CREs). During the last few years, tools 
      integrating next-generation sequencing data have been developed to improve the 
      performance of pattern matching. However, such tools have not yet been 
      comprehensively evaluated in plants. Hence, we developed a new streamlined method 
      aiming at predicting CREs and target genes of plant TFs in specific organs or 
      conditions. Our approach implements a supervised machine learning strategy, which 
      allows decision rule models to be learnt using TF ChIP-chip/seq experimental 
      data. Different layers of genomic features were integrated in predictive models: 
      the position on the gene, the DNA sequence conservation, the chromatin state and 
      various CRE footprints. Among the tested features, the chromatin features were 
      crucial for improving the accuracy of the method. Furthermore, we evaluated the 
      transferability of predictive models across TFs, organs and species. Finally, we 
      validated our method by correctly inferring the target genes of key TFs 
      controlling metabolite biosynthesis at the organ level in Arabidopsis. We 
      developed a tool-Wimtrap-to reproduce our approach in plant species and 
      conditions/organs for which ChIP-chip/seq data are available. Wimtrap is a 
      user-friendly R package that supports an R Shiny web interface and is provided 
      with pre-built models that can be used to quickly get predictions of CREs and TF 
      gene targets in different organs or conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana, Solanum 
      lycopersicum, Oryza sativa and Zea mays.

TI  - Arabidopsis heat shock transcription factor HSFA7b positively mediates salt 
      stress tolerance by binding to an E-box-like motif to regulate gene expression.
PG  - 5355-5374
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erz261 [doi]
AB  - Plant heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) are involved in heat and other 
      abiotic stress responses. However, their functions in salt tolerance are little 
      known. In this study, we characterized the function of a HSF from Arabidopsis, 
      AtHSFA7b, in salt tolerance. AtHSFA7b is a nuclear protein with transactivation 
      activity. ChIP-seq combined with an RNA-seq assay indicated that AtHSFA7b 
      preferentially binds to a novel cis-acting element, termed the E-box-like motif, 
      to regulate gene expression; it also binds to the heat shock element motif. Under 
      salt conditions, AtHSFA7b regulates its target genes to mediate serial 
      physiological changes, including maintaining cellular ion homeostasis, reducing 
      water loss rate, decreasing reactive oxygen species accumulation, and adjusting 
      osmotic potential, which ultimately leads to improved salt tolerance. 
      Additionally, most cellulose synthase-like (CSL) and cellulose synthase (CESA) 
      family genes were inhibited by AtHSFA7b; some of them were randomly selected for 
      salt tolerance characterization, and they were mainly found to negatively 
      modulate salt tolerance. By contrast, some transcription factors (TFs) were 
      induced by AtHSFA7b; among them, we randomly identified six TFs that positively 
      regulate salt tolerance. Thus, AtHSFA7b serves as a transactivator that 
      positively mediates salinity tolerance mainly through binding to the E-box-like 
      motif to regulate gene expression.

AB  - MYB transcription factors are important in abiotic stress responses; however, the 
      detailed mechanisms are unclear. Tamarix hispida contains multiple MYB genes. The 
      present study characterized T. hispida MYB8 (ThMYB8) during salt stress using 
      transgenic T. hispida and Arabidopsis assays. ThMYB8 overexpression and ThMYB8 
      RNAi analysis demonstrated that ThMYB8 enhanced the salt stress tolerance. 
      Transgenic Arabidopsis ectopic expression of ThMYB8 significantly increased root 
      growth, fresh weight, and seed germination rate compared with that of the 
      wild-type under salt stress. Physiological parameters analysis in T. hispida and 
      Arabidopsis showed that ThMYB8 overexpressing plants had the lowest levels of 
      O(2), H(2)O(2), cell death, malondialdehyde, and electrolyte leakage. 
      Overexpression of ThMYB8 regulated Na(+) and K(+) concentrations in plant tissues 
      while maintaining K(+)/Na(+) homeostasis. Analysis using qRT-PCR and ChIP-PCR 
      identified possible downstream ThMYB8-regulated genes. ThMYB8 regulated the 
      expression of ThCYP450-2 (cytochrome p450-2), Thltk (leucine-rich repeat 
      transmembrane protein kinase), and ThTIP (aquaporin TIP) by binding to the MBSI 
      motif ('CAACTG') in their promoters. The results indicated that ThMYB8 enhanced 
      salt stress tolerance in T. hispida by regulating gene expression related to the 
      activation of stress-associated physiological changes, such as enhanced reactive 
      oxygen species scavenging capability, maintaining K(+)/Na(+) homeostasis, and 
      decreasing the malondialdehyde content and lipid peroxidation cell membranes.

TI  - The walnut transcription factor JrGRAS2 contributes to high temperature stress 
      tolerance involving in Dof transcriptional regulation and HSP protein expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: GRAS transcription factor (TF) family is unique and numerous in 
      higher plants with diverse functions that involving in plant growth and 
      development processes, such as gibberellin (GA) signal transduction, root 
      development, root nodule formation, and mycorrhiza formation. Walnut tree is 
      exposed to various environmental stimulus that causing concern about its 
      resistance mechanism. In order to understand the molecular mechanism of walnut to 
      adversity response, a GRAS TF (JrGRAS2) was cloned and characterized from Juglans 
      regia in this study. RESULTS: A 1500 bp promoter fragment of JrGRAS2 was 
      identified from the genome of J. regia, in which the cis-elements were screened. 
      This JrGRAS2 promoter displayed expression activity that was enhanced 
      significantly by high temperature (HT) stress. Yeast one-hybrid assay, transient 
      expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation (Chip)-PCR analysis revealed that 
      JrDof3 could specifically bind to the DOFCOREZM motif and share similar 
      expression patterns with JrGRAS2 under HT stress. The transcription of JrGRAS2 
      was induced by HT stress and up-regulated to 6.73-~11.96-fold in the leaf and 
      2.53-~4.50-fold in the root to control, respectively. JrGRAS2 was overexpressed 
      in Arabidopsis, three lines with much high expression level of JrGRAS2 (S3, S7, 
      and S8) were selected for HT stress tolerance analysis. Compared to the wild type 
      (WT) Arabidopsis, S3, S7, and S8 exhibited enhanced seed germination rate, fresh 
      weight accumulation, and activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), 
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) under HT stress. 
      In contrast, the Evans blue staining, electrolyte leakage (EL) rates, hydrogen 
      dioxide (H(2)O(2)) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of transgenic seedlings were 
      all lower than those of WT exposed to HT stress. Furthermore, the expression of 
      heat shock proteins (HSPs) in S3, S7, and S8 was significant higher than those in 
      WT plants. The similar results were obtained in JrGRAS2 transient overexpression 
      walnut lines under normal and HT stress conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggested that JrDof3 TF contributes to improve the HT stress response of 
      JrGRAS2, which could effectively control the expression of HSPs to enhance HT 
      stress tolerance. JrGRAS2 is an useful candidate gene for heat response in plant 
      molecular breeding.

TI  - ZmMYC2 exhibits diverse functions and enhances JA signaling in transgenic 
      Arabidopsis.
PG  - 273-288
LID - 10.1007/s00299-019-02490-2 [doi]
AB  - ZmMYC2 was identified as the key regulator of JA signaling in maize and exhibited 
      diverse functions through binding to many gene promoters as well as enhanced JA 
      signaling in transgenic Arabidopsis. The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) extensively 
      coordinates plant growth, development and defensive responses. MYC2 is the master 
      regulator of JA signaling and has been widely studied in many plant species. 
      However, little is known about this transcription factor in maize. Here, we 
      identified one maize transcription factor with amino acid identity of 47% to the 
      well-studied Arabidopsis AtMYC2, named as ZmMYC2. Gene expression analysis 
      demonstrated inducible expression patterns of ZmMYC2 in response to multiple 
      plant hormone treatments, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses. The yeast 
      two-hybrid assay indicated physical interaction among ZmMYC2 and JA signal 
      repressors ZmJAZ14, ZmJAZ17, AtJAZ1 and AtJAZ9. ZmMYC2 overexpression in 
      Arabidopsis myc2myc3myc4 restored the sensitivity to JA treatment, resulting in 
      shorter root growth and inducible anthocyanin accumulation. Furthermore, 
      overexpression of ZmMYC2 in Arabidopsis elevated resistance to Botrytis cinerea. 
      Further ChIP-Seq analysis revealed diverse regulatory roles of ZmMYC2 in maize, 
      especially in the signaling crosstalk between JA and auxin. Hence, we identified 
      ZmMYC2 and characterized its roles in regulating JA-mediated growth, development 
      and defense responses.

AB  - In this protocol, we explain how to run ab initio motif discovery in order to 
      gather putative transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) from sets of genomic 
      regions returned by ChIP-seq experiments. The protocol starts from a set of peak 
      coordinates (genomic regions) which can be either downloaded from ChIP-seq 
      databases, or produced by a peak-calling software tool. We provide a concise 
      description of the successive steps to discover motifs, cluster the motifs 
      returned by different motif discovery algorithms, and compare them with reference 
      motif databases. The protocol is documented with detailed notes explaining the 
      rationale underlying the choice of options. The interpretation of the results is 
      illustrated with an example from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

TI  - A Rapeseed WRKY Transcription Factor Phosphorylated by CPK Modulates Cell Death 
      and Leaf Senescence by Regulating the Expression of ROS and SA-Synthesis-Related 
      Genes.
PG  - 7348-7359
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.0c02500 [doi]
AB  - Salicylic acid (SA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two well-defined 
      inducers of leaf senescence. Here, we identified a novel WRKY transcription 
      factor gene WSR1 (WRKY regulating SA and ROS 1) in Brassica napus (rapeseed) in 
      promoting SA and ROS production, which eventually led to leaf senescence 
      thereafter. Its expression increased in senescing leaves. Ca(2+)-dependent 
      protein kinase (CPK) 5 and -6 interacted with and phosphorylated BnaWSR1. 
      Overexpression of phosphomimic BnaWSR1 (BnaWSR1ca) in rapeseed protoplasts 
      elicited ROS production and cell death while its ectopic expression in 
      Arabidopsis enhanced SA and ROS levels and, hence, accelerated leaf senescence. 
      Furthermore, BnaWSR1ca activated the expression of Isochorismate Synthase 1 
      (ICS1), Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homologue (Rboh) D, and Senescence-Associated 
      Gene 14 (SAG14). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) assays demonstrated that 
      BnaWSR1ca directly bound to promoter regions of ICS1, RbohD, and SAG14. These 
      data have identified a CPK-WSR1 module that integrates SA and ROS to control cell 
      death and leaf senescence.

TI  - Development of Arabidopsis whole-genome microarrays and their application to the 
      discovery of binding sites for the TGA2 transcription factor in salicylic 
      acid-treated plants.
PG  - 152-62
AB  - We have developed two long-oligonucleotide microarrays for the analysis of genome 
      features in Arabidopsis thaliana, in particular for the high-throughput 
      identification of transcription factor-binding sites. The first platform contains 
      190,000 probes representing the 2-kb regions upstream of all annotated genes at a 
      density of seven probes per promoter. The second platform is divided into three 
      chips, each of over 390,000 features, and represents the entire Arabidopsis 
      genome at a density of one probe per 90 bases. Protein-DNA complexes resulting 
      from the formaldehyde fixation of leaves of plants 2 h after exposure to 1 mm 
      salicylic acid (SA) were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against the TGA2 
      transcription factor. After reversal of the cross-links and amplification, the 
      resulting ChIP sample was hybridized to both platforms. High signal ratios of the 
      ChIP sample versus raw chromatin for clusters of neighboring probes provided 
      evidence for 51 putative binding sites for TGA2, including the only previously 
      confirmed site in the promoter of PR-1 (At2g14610). Enrichment of several regions 
      was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Motif search revealed that the 
      palindromic octamer TGACGTCA was found in 55% of the enriched regions. 
      Interestingly, 15 of the putative binding sites for TGA2 lie outside the 
      presumptive promoter regions. The effect of the 2-h SA treatment on gene 
      expression was measured using Affymetrix ATH1 arrays, and SA-induced genes were 
      found to be significantly over-represented among genes neighboring putative 
      TGA2-binding sites.

TI  - MYB42 inhibits hypocotyl cell elongation by coordinating brassinosteroid 
      homeostasis and signalling in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 403-413
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcab152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The precise control of brassinosteroid (BR) homeostasis and 
      signalling is a prerequisite for hypocotyl cell elongation in plants. Arabidopsis 
      MYB42 and its paralogue MYB85 were previously identified to be positive 
      regulators of secondary cell wall formation during mature stages. Here, we aim to 
      reveal the role of MYB42 and MYB85 in hypocotyl elongation during the seedling 
      stage and clarify how MYB42 coordinates BR homeostasis and signalling to regulate 
      this process. METHODS: Histochemical analysis of proMYB42-GUS transgenic plants 
      was used for determination of the MYB42 expression pattern. The MYB42, 85 
      overexpression, double mutant and some crossing lines were generated for 
      phenotypic observation and transcriptome analysis. Transcription activation 
      assays, quantitative PCR (qPCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR and 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were conducted to determine the 
      relationship of MYB42 and BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1), a master switch 
      activating BR signalling. KEY RESULTS: MYB42 and MYB85 redundantly and negatively 
      regulate hypocotyl cell elongation. They function in hypocotyl elongation by 
      mediating BR signalling. MYB42 transcription was suppressed by BR treatment or in 
      bzr1-1D (a gain-of-function mutant of BZR1), and mutation of both MYB42 and MYB85 
      enhanced the dwarf phenotype of the BR receptor mutant bri1-5. BZR1 directly 
      repressed MYB42 expression in response to BR. Consistently, hypocotyl length of 
      bzr1-1D was increased by simultaneous mutation of MYB42 and MYB85, but was 
      reduced by overexpression of MYB42. Expression of a number of BR-regulated BZR1 
      (non-)targets associated with hypocotyl elongation was suppressed by MYB42, 85. 
      Furthermore, MYB42 enlarged its action in BR signalling through feedback 
      repression of BR accumulation and activation of DOGT1/UGT73C5, a BR-inactivating 
      enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: MYB42 inhibits hypocotyl elongation by coordinating BR 
      homeostasis and signalling during primary growth. The present study shows an 
      MYB42, 85-mediated multilevel system that contributes to fine regulation of 
      BR-induced hypocotyl elongation.

TI  - The R2R3-MYB transcription factor ThRAX2 recognized a new element MYB-T (CTTCCA) 
      to enhance cadmium tolerance in Tamarix hispida.

AB  - R2R3-MYB transcription factors play an important role in plant development and 
      response to various environmental stresses. In this study, a new R2R3-MYB gene, 
      named ThRAX2, was isolated from T. hispida. ThRAX2 has an open reading frame 
      (ORF) of 1191 bp and encodes a protein of 396 amino acids. ThRAX2 was localized 
      in the nucleus. The overexpression of ThRAX2 in Arabidopsis and T. hispida 
      significantly increased Cadmium (Cd) tolerance. Moreover, the accumulation of 
      cadmium in roots and leaves was significantly reduced. The TF-centred Y1H and Y1H 
      results showed that ThRAX2 was able to specifically bind a new cis-element 
      (MYB-T, CTTCCA). The promoters of some Cd-responsive genes, such as ThSOS1, 
      ThCKX3, ThCAX3A, ThMYB78, ThMIP2, ThTPS4, and ThSOD2, all contained 1-3 MYB-T 
      sequences. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation-polymerase chain reaction 
      (ChIP-PCR) and ChIPquantitative (q)PCR showed that the ThRAX2 gene can bind to 
      ThSOS1, ThCKX3, ThCAX3A and ThMYB78 promoter fragments, including the MYB-T 
      motif. Meanwhile, the qRTPCR results also showed that the expression trends of 
      ThSOS1, ThCKX3, ThCAX3A and ThMYB78 were similar to that of ThRAX2. This finding 
      suggests that Cd tolerance of the ThRAX2 gene may regulate the expression of some 
      downstream genes through specific recognition of the MYB-T motif and participate 
      in regulating intracellular ion homeostasis, transport, and protein activity or 
      enhance antioxidant enzyme activity. This study found a novel cis-acting element 
      that binds ThRAX2 to regulate Cd tolerance, which lays the foundation for the 
      ThRAX2 regulatory mechanism of Cd stress. This study provides a genetic and 
      theoretical basis for the bioremediation of Cd-contaminated land by cultivating 
      transgenic plants in the future.

TI  - Identifying the target genes of SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1, a master 
      transcription factor controlling DNA damage response in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 439-453
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13866 [doi]
AB  - In mammalian cells, the transcription factor p53 plays a crucial role in 
      transmitting DNA damage signals to maintain genome integrity. However, in plants, 
      orthologous genes for p53 and checkpoint proteins are absent. Instead, the 
      plant-specific transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 (SOG1) 
      controls most of the genes induced by gamma irradiation and promotes DNA repair, 
      cell cycle arrest, and stem cell death. To date, the genes directly controlled by 
      SOG1 remain largely unknown, limiting the understanding of DNA damage signaling 
      in plants. Here, we conducted a microarray analysis and chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing, and identified 146 Arabidopsis genes as 
      direct targets of SOG1. By using ChIP-sequencing data, we extracted the 
      palindromic motif [CTT(N)(7) AAG] as a consensus SOG1-binding sequence, which 
      mediates target gene induction in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, DNA 
      damage-triggered phosphorylation of SOG1 is required for efficient binding to the 
      SOG1-binding sequence. Comparison between SOG1 and p53 target genes showed that 
      both transcription factors control genes responsible for cell cycle regulation, 
      such as CDK inhibitors, and DNA repair, whereas SOG1 preferentially targets genes 
      involved in homologous recombination. We also found that defense-related genes 
      were enriched in the SOG1 target genes. Consistent with this finding, SOG1 is 
      required for resistance against the hemi-biotrophic fungus Colletotrichum 
      higginsianum, suggesting that SOG1 has a unique function in controlling the 
      immune response.

TI  - Genetic analysis of chlorophyll synthesis and degradation regulated by BALANCE of 
      CHLOROPHYLL METABOLISM.
PG  - 419-432
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiac059 [doi]
AB  - Chlorophyll (Chl) serves a number of essential functions, capturing and 
      converting light energy as a component of photosystem supercomplexes. Chl 
      degradation during leaf senescence is also required for adequate degeneration of 
      chloroplasts and salvaging of nutrients from senescent leaves. In this study, we 
      performed genetic analysis to determine the functions of BALANCE of CHLOROPHYLL 
      METABOLISM1 (BCM1) and BCM2, which control Chl levels by regulating synthesis and 
      degradation, and STAY-GREEN (SGR)1 (also known as NON-YELLOWING1 [NYE1]) and 
      SGR2, which encode Mg-dechelatase and catalyze Chl a degradation in Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana). Analysis of bcm1 bcm2 revealed that both BCM1 and BCM2 
      are involved in the regulation of Chl levels in presenescent leaves and Chl 
      degradation in senescing leaves. Analysis of bcm1 bcm2 nye1 nye2 suggested that 
      BCMs repress Chl-degrading activity in both presenescent and senescing leaves by 
      regulating SGR activity. Furthermore, transactivation analysis and chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (GLK1), a central 
      transcription factor regulating the expression of genes encoding 
      photosystem-related proteins, such as light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding proteins 
      (LHCPs), directly regulates the transcription of BCM1. LHCPs are stabilized by 
      Chl binding, suggesting that GLKs control the amount of LHCP through 
      transcriptional and post-translational regulation via BCM-mediated Chl-level 
      regulation. Meanwhile, we generated a mutant of the BCM ortholog in lettuce 
      (Lactuca sativa) by genome editing and found that it showed an early yellowing 
      phenotype, but only a slight reduction in Chl in presenescent leaves. Thus, this 
      study revealed a conserved but slightly diversified regulation of Chl and LHCP 
      levels via the GLK-BCM pathway in eudicots.

AB  - In plants, gene expression is orchestrated by thousands of transcription factors 
      (TFs). For instance, a large set of bHLH TFs are involved in the regulation of 
      iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The identification of the direct target 
      genes of TFs through uncovering the interaction between the TFs and 
      cis-regulatory elements has become an essential step toward a comprehensive 
      understanding of the iron homeostasis transcriptional regulatory network in 
      Arabidopsis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by qRT-PCR 
      (ChIP-qPCR), sequencing (ChIP-seq), or chip hybridization (ChIP-chip) is a robust 
      tool to investigate protein-DNA interactions in plants in a physiological 
      context. The procedure generally includes six steps: DNA-protein crosslink, 
      isolation of nuclei, shearing of chromatin, immunoprecipitation, DNA 
      purification, and qRT-PCR analyses. In this protocol, we describe guidelines, 
      experimental setup, and conditions for ChIP experiment in Arabidopsis. This 
      protocol focuses on seedlings grown in control and iron deficiency conditions, 
      but can readily be adapted for use with other Arabidopsis tissues or samples. In 
      addition, the protocol could also be applied to perform ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq 
      experiments.

TI  - Arabidopsis transcription factor WRKY8 functions antagonistically with its 
      interacting partner VQ9 to modulate salinity stress tolerance.
PG  - 730-45
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12159 [doi]
AB  - The WRKY transcription factors have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in 
      regulating stress responses; however, the exact mechanisms underlying their 
      involvement in stress responses are not fully understood. Arabidopsis WRKY8 was 
      predominantly expressed in roots and was highly upregulated by salt treatment. 
      Disruption of WRKY8 rendered plants hypersensitive to salt, showing delayed 
      germination, inhibited post-germination development and accelerated chlorosis. 
      Further investigation revealed that WRKY8 interacted with VQ9, and their 
      interaction decreased the DNA-binding activity of WRKY8. The VQ9 protein was 
      exclusively localized in the nucleus, and VQ9 expression was strongly responsive 
      to NaCl treatment. Mutation of VQ9 enhanced tolerance to salt stress, indicating 
      that VQ9 acts antagonistically with WRKY8 to mediate responses to salt stress. 
      The antagonist functions of WRKY8 and VQ9 were consistent with an increased or 
      reduced Na⁺/K⁺ concentration ratio, as well as contrasting expression patterns of 
      downstream stress-responsive genes in salt-stressed wrky8 and vq9 mutants. 
      Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that WRKY8 directly 
      bound the promoter of RD29A under salt conditions. These results provided strong 
      evidence that the VQ9 protein acts as a repressor of the WRKY8 factor to maintain 
      an appropriate balance of WRKY8-mediated signaling pathways to establish salinity 
      stress tolerance.

AB  - Cell type-specific transcriptional regulators play critical roles in the 
      generation and maintenance of multicellularity. As they are often expressed at 
      low levels, in vivo DNA-binding studies of these regulators by standard chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays are technically challenging. We describe here 
      an optimized ChIP protocol termed Maximized Objects for Better Enrichment 
      (MOBE)-ChIP, which enhances the sensitivity of ChIP assays for detecting cell 
      type-specific signals. The protocol, which is based on the disproportional 
      increase of target signals over background at higher scales, uses substantially 
      greater volume of starting materials than conventional ChIPs to achieve high 
      signal enrichment. This technique can capture weak binding events that are 
      ambiguous in standard ChIP assays, and is useful both in gene-specific and 
      whole-genome analysis. This protocol has been optimized for Arabidopsis, but 
      should be applicable to other model systems with minor modifications. The full 
      procedure can be completed within 3 days.

TI  - WRKY46 promotes ammonium tolerance in Arabidopsis by repressing NUDX9 and 
      indole-3-acetic acid-conjugating genes and by inhibiting ammonium efflux in the 
      root elongation zone.
PG  - 190-207
LID - 10.1111/nph.17554 [doi]
AB  - Ammonium (NH(4)(+) ) is toxic to root growth in most plants, even at moderate 
      concentrations. Transcriptional regulation is one of the most important 
      mechanisms in the response of plants to NH(4)(+) toxicity, but the nature of the 
      involvement of transcription factors (TFs) in this regulation remains unclear. 
      Here, RNA-seq analysis was performed on Arabidopsis roots to screen for 
      ammonium-responsive TFs. WRKY46, the member of the WRKY transcription factor 
      family most responsive to NH(4)(+) , was selected. We defined the role of WRKY46 
      using mutation and overexpression assays, and characterized the regulation of 
      NUDX9 and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-conjugating genes by WRKY46 via yeast 
      one-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR). 
      Knockout of WRKY46 increased, while overexpression of WRKY46 decreased, NH(4)(+) 
      -suppression of the primary root. WRKY46 is shown to directly bind to the 
      promoters of the NUDX9 and IAA-conjugating genes (GH3.1, GH3.6, UGT75D1, UGT84B2) 
      and to inhibit their transcription, thus positively regulating free IAA content 
      and stabilizing protein N-glycosylation, leading to an inhibition of NH(4)(+) 
      efflux in the root elongation zone (EZ). We identify TF involvement in the 
      regulation of NH(4)(+) efflux in the EZ, and show that WRKY46 inhibits NH(4)(+) 
      efflux by negative regulation of NUDX9 and IAA-conjugating genes.

TI  - Role of BASIC PENTACYSTEINE transcription factors in a subset of cytokinin 
      signaling responses.
PG  - 458-473
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13962 [doi]
AB  - Cytokinin plays diverse roles in plant growth and development, generally acting 
      by modulating gene transcription in target tissues. The type-B Arabidopsis 
      response regulators (ARR) transcription factors have emerged as primary targets 
      of cytokinin signaling and are required for essentially all cytokinin-mediated 
      changes in gene expression. The diversity of cytokinin function is likely 
      imparted by the activity of various transcription factors working with the type-B 
      ARRs to alter specific sets of target genes. One potential set of co-regulators 
      modulating the cytokinin response are the BARLEY B-RECOMBINANT/BASIC 
      PENTACYSTEINE (BBR/BPC) family of plant-specific transcription factors. Here, we 
      show that disruption of multiple BPCs results in reduced sensitivity to 
      cytokinin. Further, the BPCs are necessary for the induction of a subset of genes 
      in response to cytokinin. We identified direct in vivo targets of BPC6 using 
      ChIP-Seq and found an enrichment of promoters of genes differentially expressed 
      in response to cytokinin. Further, a significant number of BPC6 regulated genes 
      are also direct targets of the type-B ARRs. Potential cis-binding elements for a 
      number of other transcription factors linked to cytokinin action are enriched in 
      the BPC binding fragments, including those for the cytokinin response factors 
      (CRFs). In addition, several BPCs interact with a subset of type-A ARRs. 
      Consistent with these results, a significant number of genes whose expression is 
      altered in bpc mutant roots are also mis-expressed in crf1,3,5,6 and type-A 
      arr3,4,5,6,7,8,9,15 mutant roots. These results suggest that the BPCs are part of 
      a complex network of transcription factors that are involved in the response to 
      cytokinin.

TI  - A Membrane-Bound NAC-Like Transcription Factor OsNTL5 Represses the Flowering in 
      Oryza sativa.

AB  - In spite of short-day (SD) nature, rice (Oryza sativa) shares a conserved 
      photoperiodic network for flowering control with long-day plants like Arabidopsis 
      thaliana. Flowering or heading is an important agronomic trait in rice. NAC 
      transcription factors (TFs) are well-conserved and one of the largest families of 
      plant TFs. However, their function in flowering or heading time is not well-known 
      yet. A preferential expression of a membrane-bound NAC-like TF OsNTL5 in 
      developing leaves and panicles of rice indicated to us its putative role in 
      flowering. To examine its function, three independent constructs was generated, 
      one with a deletion in the C terminus membrane-spanning domain (OsNTL5∆C), 
      OsNTL5∆C fused with the SRDX transcriptional repressor motif and OsNTL5∆C used 
      with the VP16 activation domain under the Ubiquitin promoter to produce the 
      overexpressing lines OsNTL5∆C, OsNTL5∆C-SRDX, and OsNTL5∆C-VP, respectively in 
      rice. The OsNTL5∆C-VP line showed an early-flowering phenotype. In contrast to 
      this, the plants with OsNTL5∆C and OsNTL5∆C-SRDX showed a very strong 
      late-flowering phenotype, suggesting that OsNTL5 suppresses flowering as a 
      transcriptional repressor. The protein subcellular localization assay suggested 
      that N-terminal part of the OsNTL5 is localized to the nucleus after the protein 
      is cleaved from its membrane-spanning domain at the C-terminal end and functions 
      as a TF. Expression of flowering genes responsible for day length signals such as 
      Early Heading Date 1 (Ehd1), Heading Date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering Locus T1 
      (RFT1) was significantly changed in the overexpression lines of OsNTL5∆C-VP, 
      OsNTL5∆C, and OsNTL5∆C-SRDX as analyzed by Quantitative Real-time PCR. ChIP-qPCR 
      and rice protoplasts assays indicate that OsNTL5 directly binds to the promoter 
      of Ehd1 and negatively regulates the expression of Ehd1, which shows antagonistic 
      photoperiodic expression patterns of OsNTL5 in a 24-h SD cycle. Hence in 
      conclusion, the NAC-like TF OsNTL5 functions as a transcriptional repressor to 
      suppress flowering in rice as an upstream factor of Ehd1.

TI  - Apoplastic lipid barriers regulated by conserved homeobox transcription factors 
      extend seed longevity in multiple plant species.
PG  - 679-694
LID - 10.1111/nph.17399 [doi]
AB  - Cutin and suberin are lipid polyesters deposited in specific apoplastic 
      compartments. Their fundamental roles in plant biology include controlling the 
      movement of gases, water and solutes, and conferring pathogen resistance. Both 
      cutin and suberin have been shown to be present in the Arabidopsis seed coat 
      where they regulate seed dormancy and longevity. In this study, we use 
      accelerated and natural ageing seed assays, glutathione redox potential 
      measures, optical and transmission electron microscopy and gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry to demonstrate that increasing the accumulation 
      of lipid polyesters in the seed coat is the mechanism by which the AtHB25 
      transcription factor regulates seed permeability and longevity. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation during seed maturation revealed that the lipid polyester 
      biosynthetic gene long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 2 (LACS2) is a direct AtHB25 
      binding target. Gene transfer of this transcription factor to wheat and tomato 
      demonstrated the importance of apoplastic lipid polyesters for the maintenance of 
      seed viability. Our work establishes AtHB25 as a trans-species regulator of seed 
      longevity and has identified the deposition of apoplastic lipid barriers as a key 
      parameter to improve seed longevity in multiple plant species.

TI  - Analysis of the arabidopsis REM gene family predicts functions during flower 
      development.
PG  - 1507-15
LID - 10.1093/aob/mcu124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The REM (Reproductive Meristem) gene family of Arabidopsis 
      thaliana is part of the B3 DNA-binding domain superfamily. Despite the fact that 
      several groups have worked on the REM genes for many years, little is known about 
      the function of this transcription factor family. This study aims to identify a 
      set of REM genes involved in flower development and to characterize their 
      function. METHODS: In order to provide an overview of the REM gene family, a 
      detailed expression analysis for all REM genes of A. thaliana was performed and 
      combined with a meta-analysis of ChIP-sequencing and microarray experiments. KEY 
      RESULTS: Two sets of phylogenetically closely related REM genes, namely REM23, 
      REM24 and REM25, and REM34, REM35 and REM36, were identified as possibly being 
      involved in the early stages of flower development. Single- and double-mutant 
      combinations were analysed for these genes, and no phenotypic effects were 
      detected during flower development. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the REM34, 
      REM35 and REM36 group is the most interesting one, as REM34 is co-expressed with 
      the floral meristem identity (FMI) genes, they are bound by AP1, SVP, AP3 and PI, 
      and they are expressed in the floral meristem and during the earliest stages of 
      flower development. However, it appears that high levels of functional redundancy 
      may conceal the exact function of these transcription factor genes.

TI  - ORA47 (octadecanoid-responsive AP2/ERF-domain transcription factor 47) regulates 
      jasmonic acid and abscisic acid biosynthesis and signaling through binding to a 
      novel cis-element.
PG  - 599-613
LID - 10.1111/nph.13914 [doi]
AB  - ORA47 (octadecanoid-responsive AP2/ERF-domain transcription factor 47) of 
      Arabidopsis thaliana is an AP2/ERF domain transcription factor that regulates 
      jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis and is induced by methyl JA treatment. The regulatory 
      mechanism of ORA47 remains unclear. ORA47 is shown to bind to the cis-element 
      (NC/GT)CGNCCA, which is referred to as the O-box, in the promoter of ABI2. We 
      proposed that ORA47 acts as a connection between ABA INSENSITIVE1 (ABI1) and ABI2 
      and mediates an ABI1-ORA47-ABI2 positive feedback loop. PORA47:ORA47-GFP 
      transgenic plants were used in a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to 
      show that ORA47 participates in the biosynthesis and/or signaling pathways of 
      nine phytohormones. Specifically, many abscisic acid (ABA) and JA biosynthesis 
      and signaling genes were direct targets of ORA47 under stress conditions. The JA 
      content of the P35S:ORA47-GR lines was highly induced under wounding and 
      moderately induced under water stress relative to that of the wild-type plants. 
      The wounding treatment moderately increased ABA accumulation in the transgenic 
      lines, whereas the water stress treatment repressed the ABA content. ORA47 is 
      proposed to play a role in the biosynthesis of JA and ABA and in regulating the 
      biosynthesis and/or signaling of a suite of phytohormone genes when plants are 
      subjected to wounding and water stress.

AB  - Nearly all signal transduction pathways lead to regulation of gene expression by 
      controlling specific transcription factors (TFs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      (ChIP) is a powerful method for studying TF-DNA interactions in vivo. To identify 
      all binding sites of a TF in the genome, the DNA obtained in ChIP experiments 
      needs to be analyzed by hybridization to genome-tiling microarrays (ChIP-chip) or 
      by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq). Here, we provide detailed protocols of 
      ChIP for two model plant species Arabidopsis and rice, procedures of DNA sample 
      preparation for ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, and a general guide for computational data 
      analysis. We have used these protocols to successfully identify direct target 
      genes of the BZR1 TF of the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in both Arabidopsis 
      and rice.

TI  - LEC1 sequentially regulates the transcription of genes involved in diverse 
      developmental processes during seed development.
PG  - E6710-E6719
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1707957114 [doi]
AB  - LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1), an atypical subunit of the nuclear transcription factor 
      Y (NF-Y) CCAAT-binding transcription factor, is a central regulator that controls 
      many aspects of seed development including the maturation phase during which 
      seeds accumulate storage macromolecules and embryos acquire the ability to 
      withstand desiccation. To define the gene networks and developmental processes 
      controlled by LEC1, genes regulated directly by and downstream of LEC1 were 
      identified. We compared the mRNA profiles of wild-type and lec1-null mutant seeds 
      at several stages of development to define genes that are down-regulated or 
      up-regulated by the lec1 mutation. We used ChIP and differential gene-expression 
      analyses in Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing LEC1 and in developing 
      Arabidopsis and soybean seeds to identify globally the target genes that are 
      transcriptionally regulated by LEC1 in planta Collectively, our results show that 
      LEC1 controls distinct gene sets at different developmental stages, including 
      those that mediate the temporal transition between photosynthesis and chloroplast 
      biogenesis early in seed development and seed maturation late in development. 
      Analyses of enriched DNA sequence motifs that may act as cis-regulatory elements 
      in the promoters of LEC1 target genes suggest that LEC1 may interact with other 
      transcription factors to regulate distinct gene sets at different stages of seed 
      development. Moreover, our results demonstrate strong conservation in the 
      developmental processes and gene networks regulated by LEC1 in two dicotyledonous 
      plants that diverged ∼92 Mya.

      transgene-dependent transcriptional silencing phenomenon in the dominant ice1-1 
      Arabidopsis mutant containing the CBF3-LUC reporter, and questioned whether ICE1 
      may regulate CBF genes and may be involved in plant cold response. Here, we 
      evaluate available evidence supporting the involvement of ICE1 in plant cold

      genes and other regulatory genes known to be critical for cold response as well 
      as to the promoters of some COR genes.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis reveals the role of FOUR LIPS in response to salt stress 
      in rice.
PG  - 37-52
LID - 10.1007/s11103-022-01282-9 [doi]
AB  - An R2R3-MYB transcription factor FOUR LIPS associated with B-type 
      Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 confers salt tolerance in rice. The Arabidopsis FOUR 
      LIPS (AtFLP), an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, acts as an important stomatal 
      development regulator. Only one orthologue protein of AtFLP, Oryza sativa FLP 
      (OsFLP), was identified in rice. However, the function of OsFLP is largely 
      unknown. In this study, we conducted RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to investigate the 
      potential role of OsFLP in rice. Our results reveal that OsFLP is probably a 
      multiple functional regulator involved in many biological processes in growth 
      development and stress responses in rice. However, we mainly focus on the role of 
      OsFLP in salt stress response. Consistently, phenotypic analysis under salt 
      stress conditions showed that osflp exhibited significant sensitivity to salt 
      stress, while OsFLP over-expression lines displayed obvious salt tolerance. 
      Additionally, Yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
      (EMSA) showed that OsFLP directly bound to the promoter region of Oryza sativa 
      B-type Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 (OsCDKB1;1), and the expression of OsCDKB1;1 
      was repressed in osflp. Disturbing the expression of OsCDKB1;1 remarkably 
      enhanced the tolerance to salt stress. Taken together, our findings reveal a 
      crucial function of OsFLP regulating OsCDKB1;1 in salt tolerance and largely 
      extend the knowledge about the role of OsFLP in rice.

AB  - The Arabidopsis thaliana R2R3-MYB transcription factor AtMYB32 and its homologs 
      AtMYB4 and AtMYB7 play crucial roles in the regulation of phenylpropanoid 
      metabolism. In addition, AtMYB4 and AtMYB7 are involved in the response to 
      abiotic stress. However, the function of AtMYB32 remains unclear. In this study, 
      we found that AtMYB32 is induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and repressed by drought 
      stress. AtMYB32 positively regulates ABA-mediated seed germination and early 
      seedling development. The expression of ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3), ABI4 
      and ABI5, which encode key positive regulators of ABA signaling, was upregulated 
      in response to ABA in AtMYB32-overexpressing plants and downregulated in the 
      atmyb32-1 mutant. In addition, we found that the atmyb32-1 mutant was drought 
      resistant. Consistent with the drought-resistant phenotype, the transcript levels 
      of C-repeat binding factor 4 (CBF4) were higher in the atmyb32-1 mutant in 
      response to drought stress. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that AtMYB32 binds directly 
      to the ABI3, ABI4, ABI5 and CBF4 promoters both in vitro and in vivo. 
      Genetically, ABI4 was found to be epistatic to AtMYB32 for ABA-induced inhibition 
      of seed germination and early seedling development. Taken together, our findings 
      revealed that AtMYB32 regulates the ABA response by directly promoting ABI3, ABI4 
      and ABI5 expression and that the drought stress response likely occurs because of 
      repression of CBF4 expression.

TI  - GmGAMYB-BINDING PROTEIN 1 promotes small auxin-up RNA gene transcription to 
      modulate soybean maturity and height.
PG  - 775-791
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiad293 [doi]
AB  - Flowering time, maturity, and plant height are crucial agronomic traits 
      controlled by photoperiod that affect soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) yield and 
      regional adaptability. It is important to cultivate soybean cultivars of earlier 
      maturity that adapt to high latitudes. GAMYB-binding protein 1 (GmGBP1), a member 
      of the SNW/SKIP family of transcriptional coregulators in soybean, is induced by 
      short days and interacts with transcription factor GAMYB (GmGAMYB) during 
      photoperiod control of flowering time and maturity. In the present study, 
      GmGBP1:GmGBP1 soybean showed the phenotypes of earlier maturity and higher plant 
      height. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) assays of 
      GmGBP1-binding sites and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of differentially expressed 
      transcripts in GmGBP1:GmGBP1 further identified potential targets of GmGBP1, 
      including small auxin-up RNA (GmSAUR). GmSAUR:GmSAUR soybean also showed earlier 
      maturity and higher plant height. GmGBP1 interacted with GmGAMYB, bound to the 
      promoter of GmSAUR and promoted the expression of FLOWER LOCUS T homologs 2a 
      (GmFT2a) and FLOWERING LOCUS D LIKE 19 (GmFDL19). Flowering repressors such as 
      GmFT4 were negatively regulated, resulting in earlier flowering and maturity. 
      Furthermore, the interaction of GmGBP1 with GmGAMYB increased the gibberellin 
      (GA) signal to promote height and hypocotyl elongation by activating GmSAUR and 
      GmSAUR bound to the promoter of the GA-positive activating regulator gibberellic 
      acid-stimulated Arabidopsis 32 (GmGASA32). These results suggested a photoperiod 
      regulatory pathway in which the interaction of GmGBP1 with GmGAMYB directly 
      activated GmSAUR to promote earlier maturity and plant height in soybean.

TI  - Revisiting chromatin binding of the Arabidopsis UV-B photoreceptor UVR8.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s12870-016-0732-5 [doi]
LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plants perceive UV-B through the UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) 
      photoreceptor and UVR8 activation leads to changes in gene expression such as 
      those associated with UV-B acclimation and stress tolerance. Albeit functionally 
      unrelated, UVR8 shows some homology with RCC1 (Regulator of Chromatin 
      Condensation 1) proteins from non-plant organisms at the sequence level. These 
      proteins act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ran GTPases and bind 
      chromatin via histones. Subsequent to the revelation of this sequence homology, 
      evidence was presented showing that UVR8 activity involves interaction with 
      chromatin at the loci of some target genes through histone binding. This 
      suggested a UVR8 mode-of-action intimately and directly linked with gene 
      transcription. However, several aspects of UVR8 chromatin association remained 
      undefined, namely the impact of UV-B on the process and how UVR8 chromatin 
      association related to the transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), 
      which is important for UV-B signalling and has overlapping chromatin targets. 
      Therefore, we have investigated UVR8 chromatin association in further detail. 
      RESULTS: Unlike the claims of previous studies, our chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      (ChIP) experiments do not confirm UVR8 chromatin association. In contrast to 
      human RCC1, recombinant UVR8 also does not bind nucleosomes in vitro. Moreover, 
      fusion of a VP16 activation domain to UVR8 did not alter expression of proposed 
      UVR8 target genes in transient gene expression assays. Finally, comparison of the 
      Drosophila DmRCC1 and the Arabidopsis UVR8 crystal structures revealed that 
      critical histone- and DNA-interaction residues apparent in DmRCC1 are not 
      conserved in UVR8. CONCLUSION: This has led us to conclude that the cellular 
      activity of UVR8 likely does not involve its specific binding to chromatin at 
      target genes.

AB  - Cucumber seeds with shallow dormancy start to germinate in fruit that are 
      harvested late. ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), a transcription factor in the 
      abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway, is one of the most important regulators in 
      the transition from late embryogenesis to germination. Our analysis found a 
      candidate cis-regulatory motif for cucumber BASIC PENTACYSTEINE (CsBPC) in the 
      promoter of CsABI3. Yeast one-hybrid and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
      assays showed that CsBPCs bound to the promoter of CsABI3. Examination of 
      β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity driven by the CsABI3 promoter in transgenic 
      Arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing CsBPCs and a Nicotiana benthamiana 
      (tobacco) luciferase assay indicated that CsBPCs inhibited the expression of 
      CsABI3. Transgenic plants overexpressing CsBPCs were constructed to confirm that 
      CsBPCs participates in the control of seed germination. This study of the 
      cucumber BPC-ABI3 pathway will help to explore and characterize the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying seed germination and will provide necessary information for

AB  - BACKGROUND: Correct flower formation requires highly specific temporal and 
      spatial regulation of gene expression. In Arabidopsis thaliana the majority of 
      the master regulators that determine flower organ identity belong to the 
      MADS-domain transcription factor family. The canonical DNA binding motif for this 
      transcription factor family is the CArG-box, which has the consensus 
      CC(A/T)(6)GG. However, so far, a comprehensive analysis of MADS-domain binding 
      patterns has not yet been performed. RESULTS: Eight publicly available ChIP-seq 
      datasets of MADS-domain proteins that regulate the floral transition and flower 
      formation were analyzed. Surprisingly, the preferred DNA binding motif of each 
      protein was a CArG-box with an NAA extension. Furthermore, motifs of other 
      transcription factors were found in the vicinity of binding sites of MADS-domain 
      transcription factors, suggesting that interaction of MADS-domain proteins with 
      other transcription factors is important for target gene regulation. Finally, 
      conservation of CArG-boxes between Arabidopsis ecotypes was assessed to obtain 
      information about their evolutionary importance. CArG-boxes that fully matched 
      the consensus were more conserved than other CArG-boxes, suggesting that the 
      perfect CArG-box is evolutionary more important than other CArG-box variants. 
      CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides detailed insight into MADS-domain protein 
      binding patterns. The results underline the importance of an extended version of 
      the CArG-box and provide a first view on evolutionary conservation of MADS-domain 
      protein binding sites in Arabidopsis ecotypes.

TI  - Evolution of DNA-Binding Sites of a Floral Master Regulatory Transcription 
      Factor.
PG  - 185-200
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msv210 [doi]
AB  - Flower development is controlled by the action of key regulatory transcription 
      factors of the MADS-domain family. The function of these factors appears to be 
      highly conserved among species based on mutant phenotypes. However, the 
      conservation of their downstream processes is much less well understood, mostly 
      because the evolutionary turnover and variation of their DNA-binding sites (BSs) 
      among plant species have not yet been experimentally determined. Here, we 
      performed comparative ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)-seq experiments of the 
      MADS-domain transcription factor SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) in two closely related 
      Arabidopsis species: Arabidopsis thaliana and A. lyrata which have very similar 
      floral organ morphology. We found that BS conservation is associated with DNA 
      sequence conservation, the presence of the CArG-box BS motif and on the relative 
      position of the BS to its potential target gene. Differences in genome size and 
      structure can explain that SEP3 BSs in A. lyrata can be located more distantly to 
      their potential target genes than their counterparts in A. thaliana. In A. 
      lyrata, we identified transposition as a mechanism to generate novel SEP3 binding 
      locations in the genome. Comparative gene expression analysis shows that the 
      loss/gain of BSs is associated with a change in gene expression. In summary, this 
      study investigates the evolutionary dynamics of DNA BSs of a floral 
      key-regulatory transcription factor and explores factors affecting this 
      phenomenon.

LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcw194 [doi]
AB  - The three-dimensional shapes of chromosomes regulate gene expression and genome 
      function. Our knowledge of the role of chromatin interaction is evolving rapidly. 
      Here, we present a study of global chromatin interaction patterns in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana. High-throughput experimental techniques have been developed to map 
      long-range interactions within chromatin. We have integrated data from multiple 
      experimental sources including Hi-C, BS-seq, ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq data for 17 
      epigenetic marks and 35 transcription factors. We identified seven groups of 
      interacting loci, which can be distinguished by their epigenetic profiles. 
      Furthermore, the seven groups of interacting loci can be divided into three types 
      of chromatin linkages based on expression status. We observed that two 
      interacting loci sometimes share common epigenetic and transcription 
      factor-binding profiles. Different groups of loci display very different 
      relationships between epigenetic marks and the binding of transcription factors. 
      Distinctive types of chromatin linkages exhibit different gene expression 
      profiles. Our study unveils an entirely unexplored regulatory interaction, 
      linking epigenetic profiles, transcription factor binding and the 
      three-dimensional spatial organization of the Arabidopsis nuclear genome.

TI  - Genome-wide RNA-seq analysis indicates that the DAG1 transcription factor 
      promotes hypocotyl elongation acting on ABA, ethylene and auxin signaling.
PG  - 15895
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-34256-3 [doi]
LID - 15895
AB  - Hypocotyl elongation is influenced by light and hormones, but the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying this process are not yet fully elucidated. We had 
      previously suggested that the Arabidopsis DOF transcription factor DAG1 may be a 
      negative component of the mechanism of light-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl 
      elongation, as light-grown dag1 knock-out mutant seedlings show significant 
      shorter hypocotyls than the wild type. By using high-throughput RNA-seq, we 
      compared the transcriptome profile of dag1 and wild type hypocotyls and 
      seedlings. We identified more than 250 genes differentially expressed in dag1 
      hypocotyls, and their analysis suggests that DAG1 is involved in the promotion of 
      hypocotyl elongation through the control of ABA, ethylene and auxin signaling. 
      Consistently, ChIP-qPCR results show that DAG1 directly binds to the promoters of 
      WRKY18 encoding a transcription factor involved in ABA signaling, of the 
      ethylene- induced gene ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF2), and of the SMALL AUXIN UP 
      RNA 67 (SAUR67), an auxin-responding gene encoding a protein promoting hypocotyl 
      cell expansion.

TI  - Constitutive activation of transcription factor OsbZIP46 improves drought 
      tolerance in rice.
PG  - 1755-68
LID - 10.1104/pp.111.190389 [doi]
AB  - OsbZIP46 is one member of the third subfamily of bZIP transcription factors in 
      rice (Oryza sativa). It has high sequence similarity to ABA-responsive element 
      binding factor (ABF/AREB) transcription factors ABI5 and OsbZIP23, two 
      transcriptional activators positively regulating stress tolerance in Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice, respectively. Expression of OsbZIP46 was 
      strongly induced by drought, heat, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid (ABA) 
      treatment; however, it was not induced by salt and cold stresses. Overexpression 
      of the native OsbZIP46 gene increased ABA sensitivity but had no positive effect 
      on drought resistance. The activation domain of OsbZIP46 was defined by a series 
      of deletions, and a region (domain D) was identified as having a negative effect 
      on the activation. We produced a constitutive active form of OsbZIP46 
      (OsbZIP46CA1) with a deletion of domain D. Overexpression of OsbZIP46CA1 in rice 
      significantly increased tolerance to drought and osmotic stresses. Gene chip 
      analysis of the two overexpressors (native OsbZIP46 and the constitutive active 
      form OsbZIP46CA1) revealed that a large number of stress-related genes, many of 
      them predicted to be downstream genes of ABF/AREBs, were activated in the 
      OsbZIP46CA1 overexpressor but not (even down-regulated) in the OsbZIP46 
      overexpressor. OsbZIP46 can interact with homologs of SnRK2 protein kinases that 
      phosphorylate ABFs in Arabidopsis. These results suggest that OsbZIP46 is a 
      positive regulator of ABA signaling and drought stress tolerance of rice 
      depending on its activation. The stress-related genes activated by OsbZIP46CA1 
      are largely different from those activated by the other rice ABF/AREB homologs 
      (such as OsbZIP23), further implying the value of OsbZIP46CA1 in genetic 
      engineering of drought tolerance.

AB  - The development of high-throughput genomic sequencing coupled with chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation technologies allows studying the binding sites of the protein 
      transcription factors (TF) in the genome scale. The growth of data volume on the 
      experimentally determined binding sites raises qualitatively new problems for the 
      analysis of gene expression regulation, prediction of transcription factors 
      target genes, and regulatory gene networks reconstruction. Genome regulation 
      remains an insufficiently studied though plants have complex molecular regulatory 
      mechanisms of gene expression and response to environmental stresses. It is 
      important to develop new software tools for the analysis of the TF binding sites 
      location and their clustering in the plant genomes, visualization, and the 
      following statistical estimates. This study presents application of the analysis 
      of multiple TF binding profiles in three evolutionarily distant model plant 
      organisms. The construction and analysis of non-random ChIP-seq binding clusters 
      of the different TFs in mammalian embryonic stem cells were discussed earlier 
      using similar bioinformatics approaches. Such clusters of TF binding sites may 
      indicate the gene regulatory regions, enhancers and gene transcription regulatory 
      hubs. It can be used for analysis of the gene promoters as well as a background 
      for transcription networks reconstruction. We discuss the statistical estimates 
      of the TF binding sites clusters in the model plant genomes. The distributions of 
      the number of different TFs per binding cluster follow same power law 
      distribution for all the genomes studied. The binding clusters in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana genome were discussed here in detail.

TI  - Genome-wide (ChIP-seq) identification of target genes regulated by BdbZIP10 
      during paraquat-induced oxidative stress.
PG  - 58

AB  - BACKGROUND: bZIP transcription factors play a significant role in many aspects of 
      plant growth and development and also play critical regulatory roles during plant 
      responses to various stresses. Overexpression of the Brachypodium bZIP10 
      (Bradi1g30140) transcription factor conferred enhanced oxidative stress tolerance 
      and increased viability when plants or cells were exposed to the herbicide 
      paraquat. To gain a better understanding of genes involved in bZIP10 conferred 
      oxidative stress tolerance, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high 
      throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) was performed on BdbZIP10 overexpressing plants 
      in the presence of oxidative stress. RESULTS: We identified a transcription 
      factor binding motif, TGDCGACA, different from most known bZIP TF motifs but with 
      strong homology to the Arabidopsis zinc deficiency response element. Analysis of 
      the immunoprecipitated sequences revealed an enrichment of gene ontology groups 
      with metal ion transmembrane transporter, transferase, catalytic and binding 
      activities. Functional categories including kinases and phosphotransferases, 
      cation/ion transmembrane transporters, transferases (phosphorus-containing and 
      glycosyl groups), and some nucleoside/nucleotide binding activities were also 
      enriched. CONCLUSIONS: Brachypodium bZIP10 is involved in zinc homeostasis, as it 
      relates to oxidative stress.

AB  - Anther/pollen development is a highly programmed process in flowering plants. 
      However, the molecular mechanism of regulating anther/pollen development is still 
      largely unclear so far. Here, we report a cotton WRKY transcription factor 
      (GhWRKY22) that functions in anther/pollen development. Quantitative RT-PCR and 
      GUS activity analyses revealed that GhWRKY22 is predominantly expressed in the 
      late developing anther/pollen of cotton. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants 
      expressing GhWRKY22 displayed the male fertility defect with the fewer viable 
      pollen grains. Expression of the genes involved in jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis 
      was up-regulated, whereas expression of the JA-repressors (JAZ1 and JAZ8) was 
      down-regulated in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GhWRKY22, compared 
      with those in wild type. Yeast one-hybrid and ChIP-qPCR assays demonstrated that 
      GhWRKY22 modulated the expression of JAZ genes by directly binding to their 
      promoters for regulating anther/pollen development. Yeast two-hybrid assay 
      indicated that GhMYB24 could interact with GhJAZ8-A and GhJAZ13-A. Furthermore, 
      expression of AtMYB24, AtPAL2 and AtANS2 was enhanced in the transgenic 
      Arabidopsis plants, owing to GhWRKY22 overexpression. Taking the data together, 
      our results suggest that GhWRKY22 acts as a transcriptional repressor to regulate 
      anther/pollen development possibly by modulating the expression of the JAZ genes.

TI  - A homolog of splicing factor SF1 is essential for development and is involved in 
      the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 591-603
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12491 [doi]
AB  - During initial spliceosome assembly, SF1 binds to intron branch points and 
      interacts with U2 snRNP auxiliary factor 65 (U2AF65). Here, we present evidence 
      indicating that AtSF1, the Arabidopsis SF1 homolog, interacts with AtU2AF65a and 
      AtU2AF65b, the Arabidopsis U2AF65 homologs. A mutant allele of AtSF1 (At5g51300) 
      that contains a T-DNA insertion conferred pleiotropic developmental defects, 
      including early flowering and abnormal sensitivity to abscisic acid. An AtSF1 
      promoter-driven GUS reporter assay showed that AtSF1 promoter activity was 
      temporally and spatially altered, and that full AtSF1 promoter activity required 
      a significant proportion of the coding region. DNA chip analyses showed that only 
      a small proportion of the transcriptome was altered by more than twofold in 
      either direction in the AtSF1 mutant. Expression of the mRNAs of many heat shock 
      proteins was more than fourfold higher in the mutant strain; these mRNAs were 
      among those whose expression was increased most in the mutant strain. An RT-PCR 
      assay revealed an altered alternative splicing pattern for heat shock 
      transcription factor HsfA2 (At2g26150) in the mutant; this altered splicing is 
      probably responsible for the increased expression of the target genes induced by 
      HsfA2. Altered alternative splicing patterns were also detected for the 
      transcripts of other genes in the mutant strain. These results suggest that AtSF1 
      has functional similarities to its yeast and metazoan counterparts.

TI  - Direct roles of SPEECHLESS in the specification of stomatal self-renewing cells.
PG  - 1605-9
LID - 10.1126/science.1256888 [doi]
AB  - Lineage-specific stem cells are critical for the production and maintenance of 
      specific cell types and tissues in multicellular organisms. In Arabidopsis, the 
      initiation and proliferation of stomatal lineage cells is controlled by the basic 
      helix-loop-helix transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH). SPCH-driven asymmetric 
      and self-renewing divisions allow flexibility in stomatal production and overall 
      organ growth. How SPCH directs stomatal lineage cell behaviors, however, is 
      unclear. Here, we improved the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and 
      profiled the genome-wide targets of Arabidopsis SPCH in vivo. We found that SPCH 
      controls key regulators of cell fate and asymmetric cell divisions and modulates 
      responsiveness to peptide and phytohormone-mediated intercellular communication. 
      Our results delineate the molecular pathways that regulate an essential adult 
      stem cell lineage in plants.

TI  - BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 11 regulates chloroplast development and chlorophyll 
      synthesis in tomato fruit.
PG  - 1126-1140
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13924 [doi]
AB  - Chloroplast development and chlorophyll(Chl)metabolism in unripe tomato 
      contribute to the growth and quality of the fruit, however these mechanisms are 
      poorly understood. In this study, we initially investigated seven 
      homeobox-containing transcription factors (TFs) with specific ripening-associated 
      expression patterns using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology and 
      found that inhibiting the expression of one of these TFs, BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN11 
      (SlBEL11), significantly increased Chl levels in unripe tomato fruit. This 
      enhanced Chl accumulation was further validated by generating stable RNA 
      interference (RNAi) transgenic lines. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of RNAi-SlBEL11 
      fruit at the mature green (MG) stage showed that 48 genes involved in Chl 
      biosynthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development were significantly 
      upregulated compared with the wild type (WT) fruit. Genomic global scanning for 
      Homeobox TF binding sites combined with RNA-seq differential gene expression 
      analysis showed that 22 of these 48 genes were potential target genes of SlBEL11 
      protein. These genes included Chl biosynthesis-related genes encoding for 
      protochlorophyllide reductase (POR), magnesium chelatase H subunit (CHLH) and 
      chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO), and chloroplast development-related genes 
      encoding for chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB), homeobox protein knotted 2 
      (TKN2) and ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 2-LIKE (APRR2-like). 
      Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (ChIP-qPCR) assays were employed to 
      verify that SlBEL11 protein could bind to the promoters for TKN2, CAB and POR. 
      Taken together, our findings demonstrated that SlBEL11 plays an important role in 
      chloroplast development and Chl synthesis in tomato fruit.

TI  - PIF4 Promotes Expression of LNG1 and LNG2 to Induce Thermomorphogenic Growth in 
      Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1320
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2017.01320 [doi]
LID - 1320
AB  - Arabidopsis plants adapt to high ambient temperature by a suite of morphological 
      changes including elongation of hypocotyls and petioles and leaf hyponastic 
      growth. These morphological changes are collectively called thermomorphogenesis 
      and are believed to increase leaf cooling capacity by enhancing transpiration 
      efficiency, thereby increasing tolerance to heat stress. The bHLH transcription 
      factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) has been identified as a major 
      regulator of thermomorphogenic growth. Here, we show that PIF4 promotes the 
      expression of two homologous genes LONGIFOLIA1 (LNG1) and LONGIFOLIA2 (LNG2) that 
      have been reported to regulate leaf morphology. ChIP-Seq analyses and ChIP assays 
      showed that PIF4 directly binds to the promoters of both LNG1 and LNG2. The 
      expression of LNG1 and LNG2 is induced by high temperature in wild type plants. 
      However, the high temperature activation of LNG1 and LNG2 is compromised in the 
      pif4 mutant, indicating that PIF4 directly regulates LNG1 and LNG2 expression in 
      response to high ambient temperatures. We further show that the activities of 
      LNGs support thermomorphogenic growth. The expression of auxin biosynthetic and 
      responsive genes is decreased in the lng quadruple mutant, implying that LNGs 
      promote thermomorphogenic growth by activating the auxin pathway. Together, our 
      results demonstrate that LNG1 and LNG2 are directly regulated by PIF4 and are new 
      components for the regulation of thermomorphogenesis.

TI  - An ABRE promoter sequence is involved in osmotic stress-responsive expression of 
      the DREB2A gene, which encodes a transcription factor regulating 
      drought-inducible genes in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 2136-46
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcr143 [doi]
AB  - In plants, osmotic stress-responsive transcriptional regulation depends mainly on 
      two major classes of cis-acting elements found in the promoter regions of 
      stress-inducible genes: ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) and 
      dehydration-responsive elements (DREs). ABRE has been shown to perceive 
      ABA-mediated osmotic stress signals, whereas DRE is known to be involved in an 
      ABA-independent pathway. Previously, we reported that the transcription factor 
      DRE-BINDING PROTEIN 2A (DREB2A) regulates DRE-mediated transcription of target 
      genes under osmotic stress conditions in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). 
      However, the transcriptional regulation of DREB2A itself remains largely 
      uncharacterized. To elucidate the transcriptional mechanism associated with the 
      DREB2A gene under osmotic stress conditions, we generated a series of truncated 
      and base-substituted variants of the DREB2A promoter and evaluated their 
      transcriptional activities individually. We found that both ABRE and coupling 
      element 3 (CE3)-like sequences located approximately -100 bp from the 
      transcriptional initiation site are necessary for the dehydration-responsive 
      expression of DREB2A. Coupling our transient expression analyses with yeast 
      one-hybrid and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that the 
      ABRE-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (AREB1), AREB2 and ABRE-BINDING FACTOR 3 (ABF3) bZIP 
      transcription factors can bind to and activate the DREB2A promoter in an 
      ABRE-dependent manner. Exogenous ABA application induced only a modest 
      accumulation of the DREB2A transcript when compared with the osmotic stress 
      treatment. However, the osmotic stress-induced DREB2A expression was found to be 
      markedly impaired in several ABA-deficient and ABA-insensitive mutants. These 
      results suggest that in addition to an ABA-independent pathway, the ABA-dependent 
      pathway plays a positive role in the osmotic stress-responsive expression of 
      DREB2A.

TI  - GmBZL3 acts as a major BR signaling regulator through crosstalk with multiple 
      pathways in Glycine max.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brassinosteroids (BRs) play a crucial role in plant vegetative growth 
      and reproductive development. The transcription factors BZR1 and BES1/BZR2 are 
      well characterized as downstream regulators of the BR signaling pathway in 
      Arabidopsis and rice. Soybean contains four BZR1-like proteins (GmBZLs), and it 
      was reported that GmBZL2 plays a conserved role in BR signaling regulation. 
      However, the roles of other GmBZLs have not been thoroughly studied, and the 
      targets of GmBZLs in soybean remain unclear. RESULTS: In this study, we first 
      characterized GmBZL3 in soybean from gene expression patterns, conserved domains 
      in coding sequences, and genomic replication times of four GmBZL orthologous. The 
      results indicated that GmBZL3 might play conserved roles during soybean 
      development. The overexpression of GmBZL3(P219L) in the Arabidopsis 
      BR-insensitive mutant bri1-5 partially rescued the phenotypic defects including 
      BR-insensitivity, which provides further evidence that GmBZL3 functions are 
      conserved between soybean and the homologous Arabidopsis genes. In addition, the 
      identification of the GmBZL3 target genes through ChIP-seq technology revealed 
      that BR has broad roles in soybean and regulates multiple pathways, including 
      other hormone signaling, disease-related, and immunity response pathways. 
      Moreover, the BR-regulated GmBZL3 target genes were further identified, and the 
      results demonstrate that GmBZL3 is a major transcription factor responsible for 
      BR-regulated gene expression and soybean growth. A comparison of GmBZL3 and 
      AtBZR1/BES1 targets demonstrated that GmBZL3 might play conserved as well as 
      specific roles in the soybean BR signaling network. Finally, the identification 
      of two natural soybean varieties of the GmBZL3 mutantion by SNP analysis could 
      facilitate the understanding of gene function during soybean development in the 
      future. CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate here that GmBZL3 orchestrates a genome-wide 
      transcriptional response that underlies BR-mediated soybean early vegetative 
      growth, and our results support that BRs play crucial regulatory roles in soybean 
      morphology and gene expression levels.

TI  - MIW1 participates in ABA signaling through the regulation of MYB30 in 
      Arabidopsis.

AB  - Seed germination and seedling establishment are critical biological processes, 
      and their underlying molecular mechanisms have practical implications. The ABA 
      signaling during seed germination and early seedling development is negatively 
      regulated by transcription factor MYB30, but its interaction partners and 
      downstream targets are not fully understood. In this study, we identified MIW1 
      (MYB30-interacting WD40 protein 1), a WD40 protein that could interact with MYB30 
      and promote its degradation. In the miw1 mutant, the MYB30 protein became more 
      stable. MIW1 enhanced the ABA-mediated inhibition of postgerminative development. 
      The miw1 mutants became hyposensitive to exogenous ABA, and this effect was 
      suppressed by mutations in MYB30. Furthermore, we found that MYB30 negatively 
      regulated the expression of the ABA receptor genes PYR1/PYL/RCARs. The changes in 
      PYLs expression during early seedling development or under ABA treatment became 
      more pronounced in the myb30 mutant. ChIP-qPCR analyses showed MYB30 could 
      directly bind to the promoters of PYL11 and PYL12. Our study reveals that the 
      WD40 protein MIW1 promotes the expression of PYLs by destabilizing MYB30, thus 
      positively regulating the ABA signaling during postgermination in Arabidopsis.

TI  - Combinatorial control of Arabidopsis proline dehydrogenase transcription by 
      specific heterodimerisation of bZIP transcription factors.
PG  - 3133-43
AB  - Proline metabolism has been implicated in plant responses to abiotic stresses. 
      The Arabidopsis thaliana proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) is catalysing the first 
      step in proline degradation. Transcriptional activation of ProDH by 
      hypo-osmolarity is mediated by an ACTCAT cis element, a typical binding site of 
      basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. In this study, we demonstrate 
      by gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches, as well as chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP), that ProDH is a direct target gene of the group-S 
      bZIP factor AtbZIP53. Dimerisation studies making use of yeast and Arabidopsis 
      protoplast-based two-hybrid systems, as well as bimolecular fluorescence 
      complementation (BiFC) reveal that AtbZIP53 does not preferentially form dimers 
      with group-S bZIPs but strongly interacts with members of group-C. In particular, 
      a synergistic interplay of AtbZIP53 and group-C AtbZIP10 was demonstrated by 
      colocalisation studies, strong enhancement of ACTCAT-mediated transcription as 
      well as complementation studies in atbzip53 atbzip10 T-DNA insertion lines. 
      Heterodimer mediated activation of transcription has been found to operate 
      independent of the DNA-binding properties and is described as a crucial mechanism 
      to modulate transcription factor activity and function.

TI  - LFR Physically and Genetically Interacts With SWI/SNF Component SWI3B to Regulate 
      Leaf Blade Development in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Leaves start to develop at the peripheral zone of the shoot apical meristem. 
      Thereafter, symmetric and flattened leaf laminae are formed. These events are 
      simultaneously regulated by auxin, transcription factors, and epigenetic 
      regulatory factors. However, the relationships among these factors are not well 
      known. In this study, we conducted protein-protein interaction assays to show 
      that our previously reported Leaf and Flower Related (LFR) physically interacted 
      with SWI3B, a component of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex 
      in Arabidopsis. The results of truncated analysis and transgenic complementation 
      showed that the N-terminal domain (25-60 amino acids) of LFR was necessary for 
      its interaction with SWI3B and was crucial for LFR functions in Arabidopsis leaf 
      development. Genetic results showed that the artificial microRNA knockdown lines 
      of SWI3B (SWI3B-amic) had a similar upward-curling leaf phenotype with that of 
      LFR loss-of-function mutants. ChIP-qPCR assay was conducted to show that LFR and 
      SWI3B co-targeted the promoters of YABBY1/FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (YAB1/FIL) and IAA 
      carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (IAMT1), which were misexpressed in lfr and 
      SWI3B-amic mutants. In addition, the association between LFR and the FIL and 
      IAMT1 loci was partly hampered by the knockdown of SWI3B. These data suggest that 
      LFR interacts with the chromatin-remodeling complex component, SWI3B, and 
      influences the transcriptional expression of the important transcription factor, 
      FIL, and the auxin metabolism enzyme, IAMT1, in flattened leaf lamina 
      development.

TI  - Sulfoxidation regulation of transcription factor NAC42 influences its functions 
      in relation to stress-induced fruit ripening in banana.
PG  - 682-699
LID - 10.1093/jxb/eraa474 [doi]
AB  - Redox modification of functional or regulatory proteins has emerged as an 
      important mechanism of post-translational modification. However, the role of 
      redox modifications of transcription factors mediated by methionine sulfoxide 
      reductase (Msr) in regulating physiological processes in plants remains unclear, 
      especially in fruit ripening. In this study, we determined that MaNAC42, a 
      transcriptional activator, is involved in the regulation of fruit ripening in 
      banana under oxidative stress. Integrated analysis of ChIP-qPCR and EMSA data 
      showed that MaNAC42 directly binds to promoters of genes related to oxidative 
      stress and ripening. Ectopic overexpression of MaNAC42 in Arabidopsis delays 
      dark-induced senescence in leaves, indicating that MaNAC42 plays a negative role 
      in senescence. Furthermore, we found that MaNAC42 is a target of MaMsrB2, a 
      methionine sulfoxide reductase B. Methionine oxidation in MaNAC42 (i.e. 
      sulfoxidation) or mimicking sulfoxidation by mutating methionine to glutamine 
      both lead to decreased DNA-binding capacity and transcriptional activity. On the 
      other hand, MaMsrB2 can partially repair oxidized MaNAC42 and restore its 
      DNA-binding capacity. Thus, our results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of 
      fruit ripening in banana involving MaMsrB2-mediated redox regulation of the 
      ripening-related transcription factor MaNAC42.

TI  - The key regulator LcERF056 enhances salt tolerance by modulating reactive oxygen 
      species-related genes in Lotus corniculatus.
PG  - 605
LID - 10.1186/s12870-021-03336-4 [doi]
LID - 605
AB  - BACKGROUND: The APETALA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) family are important 
      regulatory factors involved in plants' response to environmental stimuli. 
      However, their roles in salt tolerance in Lotus corniculatus remain unclear. 
      RESULTS: Here, the key salt-responsive transcription factor LcERF056 was cloned 
      and characterised. LcERF056 belonging to the B3-1 (IX) subfamily of ERFs was 
      considerably upregulated by salt treatment. LcERF056-fused GFP was exclusively 
      localised to nuclei. Furthermore, LcERF056- overexpression (OE) transgenic 
      Arabidopsis and L. corniculatus lines exhibited significantly high tolerance to 
      salt treatment compared with wild-type (WT) or RNA interference expression (RNAi) 
      transgenic lines at the phenotypic and physiological levels. Transcriptome 
      analysis of OE, RNAi, and WT lines showed that LcERF056 regulated the downstream 
      genes involved in several metabolic pathways. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) and yeast 
      one-hybrid (Y1H) assay demonstrated that LcERF056 could bind to cis-element GCC 
      box or DRE of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes such as lipid-transfer 
      protein, peroxidase and ribosomal protein. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that 
      the key regulator LcERF056 plays important roles in salt tolerance in L. 
      corniculatus by modulating ROS-related genes. Therefore, it may be a useful 
      target for engineering salt-tolerant L. corniculatus or other crops.

TI  - A resource for characterizing genome-wide binding and putative target genes of

PG  - 887-98

AB  - Identifying transcription factor target genes is essential for modeling the 
      transcriptional networks underlying developmental processes. Here we report a 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) resource consisting of 
      genome-wide binding regions and associated putative target genes for four Populus 
      homeodomain transcription factors expressed during secondary growth and wood 
      formation. Software code (programs and scripts) for processing the Populus 
      ChIP-seq data are provided within a publically available iPlant image, including 
      tools for ChIP-seq data quality control and evaluation adapted from the human 
      Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project. Basic information for each 
      transcription factor (including members of Class I KNOX, Class III HD ZIP, 
      BEL1-like families) binding are summarized, including the number and location of 
      binding regions, distribution of binding regions relative to gene features, 
      associated putative target genes, and enriched functional categories of putative 
      target genes. These ChIP-seq data have been integrated within the Populus Genome 
      Integrative Explorer (PopGenIE) where they can be analyzed using a variety of 
      web-based tools. We present an example analysis that shows preferential binding 
      of transcription factor ARBORKNOX1 to the nearest neighbor genes in a 
      pre-calculated co-expression network module, and enrichment for meristem-related 
      genes within this module including multiple orthologs of Arabidopsis KNOTTED-like 
      Arabidopsis 2/6.

TI  - The WRKY transcription factor GhWRKY27 coordinates the senescence regulatory 
      pathway in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature senescence can reduce the yield and quality of crops. WRKY 
      transcription factors (TFs) play important roles during leaf senescence, but 
      little is known about their ageing mechanisms in cotton. RESULTS: In this study, 
      a group III WRKY TF, GhWRKY27, was isolated and characterized. The expression of 
      GhWRKY27 was induced by leaf senescence and was higher in an early-ageing cotton 
      variety than in a non-early-ageing cotton variety. Overexpression of GhWRKY27 in 
      Arabidopsis promoted leaf senescence, as determined by reduced chlorophyll 
      content and elevated expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs). Yeast 
      two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays 
      showed that GhWRKY27 interacted with an MYB TF, GhTT2. Putative target genes of 
      GhWRKY27 were identified via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing 
      (ChIP-seq). Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
      (EMSA) revealed that GhWRKY27 binds directly to the promoters of cytochrome P450 
      94C1 (GhCYP94C1) and ripening-related protein 2 (GhRipen2-2). In addition, the 
      expression patterns of GhTT2, GhCYP94C1 and GhRipen2-2 were identified during 
      leaf senescence. Transient dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that GhWRKY27 
      could activate the expression of GhCYP94C1 and GhRipen2-2. CONCLUSIONS: Our work 
      lays the foundation for further study of the functional roles of WRKY genes 
      during leaf senescence in cotton. In addition, our data provide new insights into 
      the senescence-associated mechanisms of WRKY genes in cotton.

TI  - Open chromatin in grapevine marks candidate CREs and with other chromatin

AB  - Vitis vinifera is an economically important crop and a useful model in which to 
      study chromatin dynamics. In contrast to the small and relatively simple genome 
      of Arabidopsis thaliana, grapevine contains a complex genome of 487 Mb that 
      exhibits extensive colonization by transposable elements. We used Hi-C, ChIP-seq 
      and ATAC-seq to measure how chromatin features correlate to the expression of 
      31 845 grapevine genes. ATAC-seq revealed the presence of more than 16 000 open 
      chromatin regions, of which we characterize nearly 5000 as possible distal 
      enhancer candidates that occur in intergenic space > 2 kb from the nearest 
      transcription start site (TSS). A motif search identified more than 480 
      transcription factor (TF) binding sites in these regions, with those for TCP 
      family proteins in greatest abundance. These open chromatin regions are typically 
      within 15 kb from their nearest promoter, and a gene ontology analysis indicated 
      that their nearest genes are significantly enriched for TF activity. The presence 
      of a candidate cis-regulatory element (cCRE) > 2 kb upstream of the TSS, location 
      in the active nuclear compartment as determined by Hi-C, and the enrichment of 
      H3K4me3, H3K4me1 and H3K27ac at the gene are correlated with gene expression. 
      Taken together, these results suggest that regions of intergenic open chromatin 
      identified by ATAC-seq can be considered potential candidates for cis-regulatory 
      regions in V. vinifera. Our findings enhance the characterization of a valuable 
      agricultural crop, and help to clarify the understanding of unique plant biology.

TI  - AtMYB50 regulates root cell elongation by upregulating PECTIN METHYLESTERASE 
      INHIBITOR 8 in Arabidopsis thaliana.

AB  - Plant root development involves multiple signal transduction pathways. Notably, 
      phytohormones like auxin and cytokinin are well characterized for their molecular 
      mechanisms of action. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as crucial signaling 
      molecules in controlling root development. The transcription factor, UPBEAT1 
      (UPB1) is responsible for maintaining ROS homeostasis at the root tip, 
      influencing the transition from cell proliferation to differentiation. While UPB1 
      directly regulates peroxidase expression to control ROS homeostasis, it targets 
      genes other than peroxidases, suggesting its involvement in root growth through 
      non-ROS signals. Our investigation focused on the transcription factor MYB50, a 
      direct target of UPB1, in Arabidopsis thaliana. By analyzing multiple fluorescent 
      proteins and conducting RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we unraveled a step in the MYB50 
      regulatory gene network. This analysis, in conjunction with the UPB1 regulatory 
      network, demonstrated that MYB50 directly regulates the expression of PECTIN 
      METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR 8 (PMEI8). Overexpressing PMEI8, similar to the MYB50, 
      resulted in reduced mature cell length. These findings establish MYB50 as a 
      regulator of root growth within the UPB1 gene regulatory network. Our study 
      presents a model involving transcriptional regulation by MYB50 in the UPB1 
      regulated root growth system and sheds light on cell elongation via pectin 
      modification.

TI  - The class III peroxidase PRX17 is a direct target of the MADS-box transcription 
      factor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) and participates in lignified tissue formation.
PG  - 250-263

AB  - Several physiological functions have been attributed to class III peroxidases 
      (PRXs) in plants, but the in planta role of most members of this family still 
      remains undetermined. Here, we report the first functional characterization of 
      PRX17 (At2g22420), one of the 73 members of this family in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
      Localization of PRX17 was examined by transient expression in Nicotiana 
      benthamiana. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants in A. thaliana were studied. 
      Regulation at the gene and protein levels was analyzed using β-glucuronidase 
      (GUS) activity, quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR, zymography, and 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation. Phenotypes were characterized including lignin and 
      xylan contents. PRX17 was expressed in various tissues, including vascular 
      tissues, and PRX17 was localized to the cell wall. In prx17, the lignin content 
      was reduced in the stem and siliques and bolting was delayed, while the opposite 
      phenotype was observed in 35S:PRX17 plants, together with a significant increase 
      of lignin and xylan immunofluorescence signal. Finally, we demonstrated that the 
      transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) binds to the PRX17 promoter and 
      regulates PRX17 expression level. This converging set of structural, 
      transcriptomic and physiological data suggests that PRX17, under the control of 
      AGL15, contributes to developmental programs by playing an essential role in 
      regulating age-dependent lignified tissue formation, including changes in cell 
      wall properties.

TI  - The membrane-associated transcription factor NAC089 controls ER-stress-induced 
      programmed cell death in plants.
PG  - e1004243

AB  - The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to sustain cell survival by 
      reducing misfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The 
      UPR also promotes programmed cell death (PCD) when the ER stress is severe; 
      however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are less understood, especially in 
      plants. Previously, two membrane-associated transcriptions factors (MTFs), bZIP28 
      and bZIP60, were identified as the key regulators for cell survival in the plant 
      ER stress response. Here, we report the identification of another MTF, NAC089, as 
      an important PCD regulator in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. NAC089 
      relocates from the ER membrane to the nucleus under ER stress conditions. 
      Inducible expression of a truncated form of NAC089, in which the transmembrane 
      domain is deleted, induces PCD with increased caspase 3/7-like activity and DNA 
      fragmentation. Knock-down NAC089 in Arabidopsis confers ER stress tolerance and 
      impairs ER-stress-induced caspase-like activity. Transcriptional regulation 
      analysis and ChIP-qPCR reveal that NAC089 plays important role in regulating 
      downstream genes involved in PCD, such as NAC094, MC5 and BAG6. Furthermore, 
      NAC089 is up-regulated by ER stress, which is directly controlled by bZIP28 and 
      bZIP60. These results show that nuclear relocation of NAC089 promotes 
      ER-stress-induced PCD, and both pro-survival and pro-death signals are elicited 
      by bZIP28 and bZIP60 during plant ER stress response.

AB  - WRKY transcription factors play key roles in plant biotic and abiotic stress 
      responses, but the function of some MaWRKYs remains elusive. Here, we 
      characterized the positive role of MaWRKY80 in drought stress resistance and the 
      underlying mechanism. MaWRKY80 was significantly upregulated under drought stress 
      and confirmed as a transcription factor that could bind to the W-box. 
      Overexpression of MaWRKY80 in Arabidopsis showed better phenotypic morphology, 
      higher survival rate, less water loss rate, and lower malondialdehyde level than 
      wild type (WT) under drought stress. Consistently, MaWRKY80 transgenic 
      Arabidopsis leaves displayed significantly lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      than WT under drought stress. Moreover, MaWRKY80 mediated the stomata movement 
      and leaf water retention capacity through modulation of the transcript of 
      9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs) and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis 
      in Arabidopsis. Notably, chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative real-time PCR 
      (ChIP-PCR) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) provided evidences 
      supporting the direct and specific interaction between MaWRKY80 and both the 
      W-box in AtNCEDs promoter in Arabidopsis and the W-box in MaNCEDs promoter in 
      banana. Taken together, MaWRKY80 serves as a positive regulator of drought stress 
      resistance through modulating ABA level by regulating NCEDs expression and ROS 
      accumulation by regulating antioxidant system. This study provides a novel 
      insight into MaWRKY80 in coordinating ABA synthesis and ROS elimination in 
      response to drought stress.

TI  - An LRR-only protein regulates abscisic acid-mediated abiotic stress responses 
      during Arabidopsis seed germination.
PG  - 909-920
LID - 10.1007/s00299-020-02538-8 [doi]
AB  - LRRop-1, induced by DOF6 transcription factor, negatively regulates abiotic 
      stress responses during Arabidopsis seed germination. The lrrop-1 mutant has 
      reduced ABA signaling, which is part of the underlying stress-remediation 
      mechanism. The large family of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins plays a role in 
      plant immune responses. Most LRR proteins have multiple functional domains, but a 
      subfamily is known to possess only the LRR domain. The roles of these LRR-only 
      proteins in Arabidopsis remain largely uncharacterized. In the present study, we 
      have identified 44 LRR-only proteins in Arabidopsis and phylogenetically 
      classified them into nine sub-groups. We characterized the function of LRRop-1, 
      belonging to sub-group V. LRRop-1 encodes a predominantly ER-localized LRR 
      domain-containing protein that is highly expressed in seeds and rosette leaves. 
      Promoter motif analysis revealed an enrichment in binding sites for several 
      GA-responsive and stress-responsive transcription factors. The lrrop-1 mutant 
      seeds showed enhanced seed germination on medium containing abscisic acid (ABA), 
      paclobutrazol and NaCl compared to the wild type (WT), demonstrating higher 
      abiotic stress tolerance. Also, the lrrop-1 mutant seeds have lower levels of 
      endogenous ABA, but higher levels of gibberellic acid (GA) and jasmonic acid-Ile 
      (JA-Ile) compared to the WT. Furthermore, lrrop-1 mutant seeds imbibed with ABA 
      exhibited reduced expression of ABA-responsive genes compared to similarly 
      treated WT seeds, suggesting suppressed ABA signaling events in the mutant. 
      Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data showed that DNA BINDING1 
      ZINC FINGER6 (DOF6), a negative regulator of seed germination, could directly 
      bind to the LRRop-1 promoter and up-regulate its expression. Thus, our results 
      show that LRRop-1 regulates ABA-mediated abiotic stress responses during 
      Arabidopsis seed germination.

TI  - Arabidopsis flowering integrator SOC1 transcriptionally regulates autophagy in 
      response to long-term carbon starvation.
PG  - 6589-6599
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erac298 [doi]
AB  - Autophagy is a highly conserved, self-digestion process that is essential for 
      plant adaptations to various environmental stresses. Although the core components 
      of autophagy in plants have been well established, the molecular basis for its 
      transcriptional regulation remains to be fully characterized. In this study, we 
      demonstrate that SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1), a MADS-box 
      family transcription factor that determines flowering transition in Arabidopsis, 
      functions as a transcriptional repressor of autophagy. EMSAs, ChIP-qPCR assays, 
      and dual-luciferase receptor assays showed that SOC1 can bind to the promoters of 
      ATG4b, ATG7, and ATG18c via the conserved CArG box. qRT-PCR analysis showed that 
      the three ATG genes ATG4b, ATG7, and ATG18c were up-regulated in the soc1-2 
      mutant. In line with this, the mutant also displayed enhanced autophagy activity, 
      as revealed by increased autophagosome formation and elevated autophagic flux 
      compared with the wild type. More importantly, SOC1 negatively affected the 
      tolerance of plants to long-term carbon starvation, and this process requires a 
      functional autophagy pathway. Finally, we found that SOC1 was repressed upon 
      carbon starvation at both the transcriptional and protein levels. Overall, our 
      study not only uncovers an important transcriptional mechanism that contributes 
      to the regulation of plant autophagy in response to nutrient starvation, but also 
      highlights novel cellular functions of the flowering integrator SOC1.

TI  - Arabidopsis JAGGED links floral organ patterning to tissue growth by repressing 
      Kip-related cell cycle inhibitors.
PG  - 2830-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1320457111 [doi]
AB  - Plant morphogenesis requires coordinated cytoplasmic growth, oriented cell wall 
      extension, and cell cycle progression, but it is debated which of these processes 
      are primary drivers for tissue growth and directly targeted by developmental 
      genes. Here, we used ChIP high-throughput sequencing combined with transcriptome 
      analysis to identify global target genes of the Arabidopsis transcription factor 
      JAGGED (JAG), which promotes growth of the distal region of floral organs. 
      Consistent with the roles of JAG during organ initiation and subsequent distal 
      organ growth, we found that JAG directly repressed genes involved in meristem 
      development, such as CLAVATA1 and HANABA TARANU, and genes involved in the 
      development of the basal region of shoot organs, such as BLADE ON PETIOLE 2 and 
      the GROWTH REGULATORY FACTOR pathway. At the same time, JAG regulated genes 
      involved in tissue polarity, cell wall modification, and cell cycle progression. 
      In particular, JAG directly repressed KIP RELATED PROTEIN 4 (KRP4) and KRP2, 
      which control the transition to the DNA synthesis phase (S-phase) of the cell 
      cycle. The krp2 and krp4 mutations suppressed jag defects in organ growth and in 
      the morphology of petal epidermal cells, showing that the interaction between JAG 
      and KRP genes is functionally relevant. Our work reveals that JAG is a direct 
      mediator between genetic pathways involved in organ patterning and cellular 
      functions required for tissue growth, and it shows that a regulatory gene shapes 
      plant organs by releasing a constraint on S-phase entry.

TI  - TAF15b, involved in the autonomous pathway for flowering, represses transcription 
      of FLOWERING LOCUS C.
PG  - 79-91

AB  - TATA-binding protein-associated factors (TAFs) are general transcription factors 
      within the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which recognizes the core 
      promoter of genes. In addition to their biochemical function, it is known that 
      several TAFs are involved in the regulation of developmental processes. In this 
      study, we found that TAF15b affects flowering time, especially through the 
      autonomous pathway (AP) in Arabidopsis. The mutant taf15b shows late flowering 
      compared with the wild type plant during both long and short days, and 
      vernalization accelerates the flowering time of taf15b. In addition, taf15b shows 
      strong upregulation of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a flowering repressor in 
      Arabidopsis, and the flc taf15b double mutant completely offsets the late 
      flowering of taf15b, indicating that TAF15b is a typical AP gene. The taf15b 
      mutant also shows increased transcript levels of COOLAIR, an antisense transcript 
      of FLC. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses showed that 
      the TAF15b protein is enriched around both sense and antisense transcription 
      start sites of the FLC locus. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation showed that 
      TAF15b interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II), while ChIP showed increased 
      enrichment of the phosphorylated forms, both serine 2 (Ser2) and Ser5, of the 
      C-terminal domain of Pol II at the FLC locus, which is indicative of 
      transcriptional elongation. Finally, taf15b showed higher enrichment of the 
      active histone marker, H3K4me3, on FLC chromatin. Taken together, our results 
      suggest that TAF15b affects flowering time through transcriptional repression of 
      FLC in Arabidopsis.

TI  - Salinity stress-induced phosphorylation of INDETERMINATE-DOMAIN 4 (IDD4) by MPK6 
      regulates plant growth adaptation in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1265687

AB  - The INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) family belongs to a group of plant-specific 
      transcription factors that coordinates plant growth/development and immunity. 
      However, the function and mode of action of IDDs during abiotic stress, such as 
      salt, are poorly understood. We used idd4 transgenic lines and screened them 
      under salt stress to find the involvement of IDD4 in salinity stress tolerance 
      The genetic disruption of IDD4 increases salt-tolerance, characterized by 
      sustained plant growth, improved Na(+)/K(+) ratio, and decreased stomatal 
      density/aperture. Yet, IDD4 overexpressing plants were hypersensitive to 
      salt-stress with an increase in stomatal density and pore size. Transcriptomic 
      and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that IDD4 directly controls an important set of 
      genes involved in abiotic stress/salinity responses. Interestingly, using 
      anti-IDD4-pS73 antibody we discovered that IDD4 is specifically phosphorylated at 
      serine-73 by MPK6 in vivo under salinity stress. Analysis of plants expressing 
      the phospho-dead and phospho-mimicking IDD4 versions proved that phosphorylation 
      of IDD4 plays a crucial role in plant transcriptional reprogramming of 
      salt-stress genes. Altogether, we show that salt stress adaption involves MPK6 
      phosphorylation of IDD4 thereby regulating IDD4 DNA-binding and expression of 
      target genes.

TI  - Arabidopsis OXS3 family proteins repress ABA signaling through interactions with 
      AFP1 in the regulation of ABI4 expression.
PG  - 5721-5734
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erab237 [doi]
AB  - Abscisic acid (ABA) and the AP2/ERF (APETALA2/ETHYLENE-RESPONSIVE FACTOR)-type 
      transcription factor called ABA INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) play pivotal roles in plant 
      growth responses to environmental stress. An analysis of seedling development in 
      Arabidopsis ABA hypersensitive mutants suggested that OXS3 (OXIDATIVE STRESS 3), 
      OXS3b, O3L3 (OXS3 LIKE 3), O3L4, and O3L6 were negative regulators of ABI4 
      expression. We therefore characterized the roles of the OXS3 family members in 
      ABA signaling. All the above five OXS3 proteins were found to interact with AFP1 
      (ABI FIVE BINDING PROTEIN 1) in yeast two hybrid assays. Seven OXS3 family 
      members including two other members O3L1 and O3L5 were found to interact with 
      histone H2A.X, although OXS3b, O3L3, and O3L5 showed weaker interactions. 
      ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that the absence of some of these OXS3 family proteins 
      was associated with increased occupancy of histone γ-H2A.X at the ABI4 promoter, 
      which also corresponded with de-repression of ABI4 expression. Repression of ABI4 
      expression, however, required both AFP1 and OXS3, OXS3b or O3L6. We conclude that 
      in the absence of stress, OXS3 family proteins regulate γ-H2A.X deposition at the 
      ABI4 promoter and that together with AFP1, OXS3 family proteins function to 
      prevent ABA-induced growth arrest by co-repressing ABI4 through decreased 
      promoter occupancy of histone γ-H2A.X.

TI  - A fast, efficient chromatin immunoprecipitation method for studying protein-DNA 
      binding in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.1186/s13007-017-0192-4 [doi]
LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Binding of transcription factors to their target sequences is a 
      primary step in the regulation of gene expression and largely determines gene 
      regulatory networks. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is an indispensable 
      tool used to investigate the binding of DNA-binding proteins (e.g., transcription 
      factors) to their target sequences in vivo. ChIP assays require specific 
      antibodies that recognize endogenous target transcription factors; however, in 
      most cases, such specific antibodies are unavailable. To overcome this problem, 
      many ChIP assays use transgenic plants that express epitope-tagged transcription 
      factors and immunoprecipitate the protein with a tag-specific antibody. However, 
      generating transgenic plants that stably express epitope-tagged proteins is 
      difficult and time-consuming. RESULTS: Here, we present a rapid, efficient ChIP 
      protocol using transient expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts that can 
      be completed in 4 days. We provide optimized experimental conditions, including 
      the amount of transfected DNA and the number of protoplasts. We also show that 
      the efficiency of our ChIP protocol using protoplasts is comparable to that 
      obtained using transgenic Arabidopsis plants. We propose that our ChIP method can 
      be used to analyze in vivo interactions between tissue-specific transcription 
      factors and their target sequences, to test the effect of genotype on the binding 
      of a transcription factor within a protein complex to its target sequences, and 
      to measure temperature-dependent binding of a transcription factor to its target 
      sequence. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid and simple nature of our ChIP assay using 
      Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts facilitates the investigation of in vivo 
      interactions between transcription factors and their target genes.

TI  - WRKY41 controls Arabidopsis seed dormancy via direct regulation of ABI3 
      transcript levels not downstream of ABA.
PG  - 810-23
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12597 [doi]
AB  - Although seed dormancy is an important agronomic trait, its molecular basis is 
      poorly understood. ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) plays an essential role in 
      the establishment of seed dormancy. Here, we show that the lack of a 
      seed-expressed WRKY transcription factor, WRKY41, confers reduced primary seed 
      dormancy and thermoinhibition, phenotypes resembling those for a lack of ABI3. 
      Loss-of-function abi3-17 and wrky41 alleles also both confer reduced sensitivity 
      to ABA during germination and early seedling growth. Absence of WRKY41 decreases 
      ABI3 transcript abundance in maturing and imbibed seeds, whereas transgenically 
      overexpressing WRKY41 increases ABI3 expression. Moreover, transgenic 
      overexpression of ABI3 completely restores seed dormancy phenotypes on wrky41. 
      ChIP-qPCR and EMSA reveal that WRKY41 binds directly to the ABI3 promoter through 
      three adjacent W-boxes, and a transactivation assay indicates that these W-boxes 
      are essential for ABI3 expression. Whilst RT-qPCR analysis shows that the 
      regulation of ABI3 by WRKY41 is not through ABA and other factors known to 
      promote ABI3 transcription during seed maturation and germination, we also show 
      that high concentrations of ABA might promote negative feedback regulation of 
      WRKY41 expression. Finally, analysis of the wrky41 aba2 double mutant confirms 
      that WRKY41 and ABA collaboratively regulate ABI3 expression and seed dormancy. 
      In summary, our results demonstrate that WRKY41 is an important regulator of ABI3 
      expression, and hence of seed dormancy.

TI  - DNA-Binding Factor Target Identification by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

AB  - Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) allows the precise identification of genomic 
      loci that physically interact with a protein of interest, whether that protein is 
      a transcription factor, a core polymerase, a histone, or other 
      chromatin-associated protein. In short, tissue is first cross-linked to freeze a 
      population of DNA-protein interactions at a stage of interest. Chromatin is then 
      extracted, fragmented, and incubated with a specific antibody against the protein 
      of interest. Next, the resultant DNA-protein complexes are immunoprecipitated and 
      captured using beads that bind to the antibody constant region. Samples are 
      finally reverse cross-linked to separate the bound fragments and the DNA is 
      purified. This DNA is analyzed by quantitative PCR for enrichment of genomic 
      regions expected to be bound by the protein under study. The protocol detailed in 
      this chapter has been successfully applied in the identification of target genes 
      for seven transcriptional regulators of diverse classes involved in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana floral transition.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-2815-7_1 [doi]
AB  - The TARGET system allows for the rapid identification of direct regulated gene 
      targets of transcription factors (TFs). It employs the transient transformation 
      of plant protoplasts with inducible nuclear entry of the TF and subsequent 
      transcriptomic and/or ChIP-seq analysis. The ability to separate direct TF-target 
      gene regulatory interactions from indirect downstream responses and the 
      significantly shorter amount of time required to perform the assay, compared to 
      the generation of transgenics, make this plant cell-based approach a valuable 
      tool for a higher throughput approach to identify the genome-wide targets of 
      multiple TFs, to build validated transcriptional networks in plants. Here, we 
      describe the use of the TARGET system in Arabidopsis seedling root protoplasts to 
      map the gene regulatory network downstream of transcription factors-of-interest.

TI  - Arabidopsis cold shock domain proteins: relationships to floral and silique 
      development.
PG  - 1047-62
LID - 10.1093/jxb/ern351 [doi]
AB  - Cold shock domain proteins (CSPs) are highly conserved from bacteria to higher 
      plants and animals. Bacterial cold shock proteins function as RNA chaperones by 
      destabilizing RNA secondary structures and promoting translation as an adaptative 
      mechanism to low temperature stress. In animals, cold shock domain proteins 
      exhibit broad functions related to growth and development. In order to understand 
      better the function of CSPs in planta, detailed analyses were performed for 
      Arabidopsis thaliana CSPs (AtCSPs) on the transcript and protein levels using an 
      extensive series of tissue harvested throughout developmental stages within the 
      entire life cycle of Arabidopsis. On both the transcript and protein levels, 
      AtCSPs were enriched in shoot apical meristems and siliques. Although all AtCSPs 
      exhibited similar expression patterns, AtCSP2 was the most abundantly expressed 
      gene. In situ hybridization analyses were also used to confirm that AtCSP2 and 
      AtCSP4 transcripts accumulate in developing embryos and shoot apices. AtCSPs 
      transcripts were also induced during a controlled floral induction study. In vivo 
      ChIP analysis confirmed that an embryo expressed MADS box transcription factor, 
      AGL15, interacts within two AtCSP promoter regions and alters the respective 
      patterns of AtCSP transcription. Comparative analysis of AtCSP gene expression 
      between Landsberg and Columbia ecotypes confirmed a 1000-fold reduction of AtCSP4 
      gene expression in the Landsberg background. Analysis of the AtCSP4 genomic locus 
      identified multiple polymorphisms in putative regulatory cis-elements between the 
      two ecotypes. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that AtCSPs are 
      involved in the transition to flowering and silique development in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Transcripts of the Arabidopsis transcription factor gene, AtMYB44, accumulate 
      rapidly to mediate a tolerance mechanism in response to salt stress. The AtMYB44 
      promoter is activated by salt stress, as illustrated in AtMYB44pro::GUS 
      transgenic plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that RNA 
      polymerases were enriched on the AtMYB44 gene, especially on TSS-proximal 
      regions, and nucleosome density was markedly reduced in the AtMYB44 gene-body 
      region in response to salt stress. In addition, H2A.Z occupation was 
      significantly decreased at the AtMYB44 promoter, transcription start site (TSS), 
      and gene-body regions. Histone modifications including histone H3 lysine 4 
      trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 and H4 acetylation (H3ac and H4ac) were 
      not affected under the same stress conditions. We found a decrease in the number 
      of AtMYB44 proteins bound to their own gene promoters in response to salt stress. 
      These results suggest that salt stress induces the eviction of H2A.Z-containing 
      nucleosomes from the AtMYB44 promoter region, which may weaken its affinity for 
      binding AtMYB44 protein that acts as a repressor for AtMYB44 gene transcription 
      under salt stress-free conditions.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, classic genetic approaches have shown that the 
      developmental program underlying flower formation involves a large number of 
      transcriptional regulators. However, the target genes of these transcription 
      factors, as well as the gene regulatory networks they control, remain largely 
      unknown. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to next-generation sequencing 
      (ChIP-Seq), which allows the identification of transcription factor binding sites 
      on a genome-wide scale, has been successfully applied to a number of 
      transcription factors in Arabidopsis. The ChIP-Seq procedure involves chemical 
      cross-linking of proteins to DNA, followed by chromatin fragmentation and 
      immunoprecipitation of specific protein-DNA complexes. The regions of the genome 
      bound by a specific transcription factor can then be identified after 
      next-generation sequencing.

TI  - Genome-wide (ChIP-seq) identification of target genes regulated by WRKY33 during 
      submergence stress in Arabidopsis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoxia induced by flooding causes significant losses to crop 
      production almost every year. However, the molecular network of submergence 
      signaling pathway is still poorly understood. According to previous studies, 
      transgenic plants overexpressing the WRKY33 gene showed enhanced resistance to 
      submergence stress. Thus, this transcription factor may regulate a series of 
      target genes in response to submergence. Here, to determine putative downstream 
      targets of WRKY33 at a genome-wide scale in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed 
      the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) using 35S:FLAG-WRKY33 
      overexpression transgenic lines (WRKY33-OE) after 24 h of submergence treatment. 
      RESULTS: Using ChIP-seq data, we identified a total of 104 WRKY33-binding genes 
      under submergence stress (WRKY33BGSs). Most WRKY33BGSs are involved in the 
      oxidation-reduction process, programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen 
      species, lipid biosynthesis process, and other processes related to stress 
      responses. Moreover, the major motif identified in the WRKY33BGSs promoters is a 
      new cis-element, TCTCTC (named here as "TC box"). This cis-element differs from 
      the previously known W box for WRKY33. Further qPCR experiments verified that 
      genes carrying this motif in their promoters could be regulated by WRKY33 upon 
      submergence treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified a new putative 
      binding motif of WRKY33 and recovered numerous previously unknown target genes of 
      WRKY33 during submergence stress. The WRKY33 gene positively participates in 
      flooding response probably by transcriptional regulation of the downstream 
      submergence-related target genes via a "TC box".

TI  - The wheat transcription factor TaGAMyb recruits histone acetyltransferase and 
      activates the expression of a high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit gene.
PG  - 347-59
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13003 [doi]
AB  - Glutenin proteins in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour confer unique 
      viscoelastic properties to dough products and, therefore, the concentration and 
      composition of the glutenin proteins determine its end-use value. However, the 
      mechanisms governing the glutenin gene expression remain elusive. In this study, 
      we report that wheat TaGAMyb activates the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit 
      genes (TaGLU) through recruiting the histone acetyltransferase GCN5. By 
      sequencing the promoters of TaGLU-1 genes from 40 modern wheat cultivars, we 
      identified eight types of TaGAMyb binding motifs and verified these by 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The number of TaGAMyb binding motifs in 
      TaGLU-1 genes is correlated with the abundance of glutenin in different 
      cultivars. Chromatin immunoprecipitation plus polymerase chain reaction 
      (ChIP-PCR) analysis reveals that TaGCN5 directly targets the promoters of TaGLU-1 
      genes in wheat endosperm. We find that TaGAMyb physically interacts with the 
      wheat histone acetyltransferase TaGCN5 and also interacts with Arabidopsis 
      thaliana AtGCN5. TaGAMyb ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis binds to the 
      TaGLU-1Dy promoter on a TaGLU-1Dy transgene and activates its expression. AtGCN5 
      also targets the TaGLU-1Dy transgene and is involved in the establishment of 
      acetylation at H3K9 and H3K14. These results demonstrate that TaGAMyb plays a 
      dual role in activating expression of glutenin gene by directly binding to the 
      TaGLU promoter and by recruiting GCN5 to modulate histone acetylation during 
      wheat endosperm development.

TI  - Arabidopsis CLAVATA1 and CLAVATA2 receptors contribute to Ralstonia solanacearum 
      pathogenicity through a miR169-dependent pathway.
PG  - 502-15
LID - 10.1111/nph.13913 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is one of the most destructive 
      bacterial plant diseases. Although many molecular determinants involved in 
      R. solanacearum adaptation to hosts and pathogenesis have been described, host 
      components required for disease establishment remain poorly characterized. 
      Phenotypical analysis of Arabidopsis mutants for leucine-rich repeat 
      (LRR)-receptor-like proteins revealed that mutations in the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) and 
      CLAVATA2 (CLV2) genes confer enhanced disease resistance to bacterial wilt. We 
      further investigated the underlying mechanisms using genetic, transcriptomic and 
      molecular approaches. The enhanced resistance of both clv1 and clv2 mutants to 
      the bacteria did not require the well characterized CLV signalling modules 
      involved in shoot meristem homeostasis, and was conditioned by neither salicylic 
      acid nor ethylene defence-related hormones. Gene expression microarray analysis 
      performed on clv1 and clv2 revealed deregulation of genes encoding nuclear 
      transcription factor Y subunit alpha (NF-YA) transcription factors whose 
      post-transcriptional regulation is known to involve microRNAs from the miR169 
      family. Both clv mutants showed a defect in miR169 accumulation. Conversely, 
      overexpression of miR169 abrogated the resistance phenotype of clv mutants. We 
      propose that CLV1 and CLV2, two receptors involved in CLV3 perception during 
      plant development, contribute to bacterial wilt through a signalling pathway 
      involving the miR169/NF-YA module.

PG  - 177-93
LID - 10.1007/978-1-62703-773-0_12 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide quantitative profiling of chromatin modifications is a critical 
      experimental approach to study epigenetic and transcriptional control mechanisms. 
      Since first being reported in 2007, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by 
      high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) has soon became a popular method-of-choice 
      for profiling chromatin modifications and transcription factor-binding sites in 
      eukaryote genomes. ChIP-seq has the advantage over the earlier ChIP-chip approach 
      in multiple aspects including the lower amount of input DNA required, an expanded 
      dynamic range and compatibility with sample multiplexing. Here we describe a 
      detailed protocol for profiling histone modification in the Arabidopsis thaliana 
      genome with ChIP-seq using the SOLiD™ 2.0 high-throughput sequencing platform. As 
      read length and sequencing depth are two critical factors determining data 
      quality and cost, we have developed bioinformatics approach to evaluate the 
      effect of read length and sequencing depth on the alignment accuracy and the 
      generated chromatin profile, respectively. Our analyses suggest that 2-3 million 
      high quality sequencing tags with a read length of 35 nucleotides would be 
      sufficient to profile the majority of histone modifications in this popular model 
      plant species.

TI  - Overexpression of the transcription factor ANAC017 results in a genomes uncoupled 
      phenotype under lincomycin.
PG  - 91-108

AB  - Over-expression (OE) lines for the ER-tethered NAC transcription factor ANAC017 
      displayed de-repression of gun marker genes when grown on lincomycin (lin). 
      RNA-seq revealed that ANAC017OE2 plants constitutively expressed greater than 40% 
      of the genes induced in wild-type with lin treatment, including plastid encoded 
      genes ycf1.2 and the gene cluster ndhH-ndhA-ndhI-ndhG-ndhE-psaC-ndhD, documented 
      as direct RNA targets of GUN1. Genes encoding components involved in organelle 
      translation were enriched in constitutively expressed genes in ANAC017OE2. 
      ANAC017OE resulted in constitutive location in the nucleus and significant 
      constitutive binding of ANAC017 was detected by ChIP-Seq to target genes. 
      ANAC017OE2 lines maintained the ability to green on lin, were more ABA sensitive, 
      did not show photo-oxidative damage after exposure of de-etiolated seedlings to 
      continuous light and the transcriptome response to lin were as much as 80% unique 
      compared to gun1-1. Both double mutants, gun1-1:ANAC017OE and bzip60:ANAC017OE 
      (but not single bzip60), have a gun molecular gene expression pattern and result 
      in variegated and green plants, suggesting that ANAC017OE may act through an 
      independent pathway compared to gun1. Over-expression of ANAC013 or rcd1 did not 
      produce a GUN phenotype or green plants on lin. Thus, constitutive ANAC017OE2 
      establishes an alternative transcriptional program that likely acts through a 
      number of pathways, that is, maintains plastid gene expression, and induction of 
      a variety of transcription factors involved in reactive oxygen species 
      metabolism, priming plants for lin tolerance to give a gun phenotype.

AB  - Floral transition in Arabidopsis is tightly controlled by complex genetic 
      regulatory networks in response to endogenous and environmental flowering 
      signals. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) and SHORT VEGETATIVE 
      PHASE (SVP), two key MADS-domain transcription factors, perceive these signals 
      and function as antagonistic flowering regulators. To understand how these 
      factors mediate floral transition, we mapped in vivo binding sites of SOC1 and 
      SVP using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by hybridization to whole-genome 
      tiling arrays (ChIP-chip). Genes that encoded proteins with transcription 
      regulator activity and transcription factor activity were the most enriched 
      groups of genes of those bound by SOC1 and SVP, which indicates their central 
      roles in flowering regulatory networks. In combination with gene expression 
      microarray studies, we further identified the genes whose expression was 
      controlled directly by SOC1 or SVP. Among the common direct targets identified, 
      APETALA2 (AP2)-like genes that repress FT and SOC1 expression were down-regulated 
      by SOC1, but up-regulated by SVP, revealing a complex feedback regulation among 
      the key genes that determine the integration of flowering signals. SOC1 
      regulatory regions were also accessed by SOC1 itself and SVP, suggesting that 
      self-activation and repression by SVP contribute to the control of SOC1 
      expression. In addition, ChIP-chip analysis demonstrated that miR156e and 
      miR172a, which are involved in the regulation of AP2-like genes, were direct 
      targets of SOC1 and SVP, respectively. Taken together, these findings revealed 
      that feedback regulatory loops mediated by SOC1 and SVP are essential components 
      of the gene regulatory networks that underpin the integration of flowering 
      signals during floral transition.

AB  - Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a widely used method to map the position 
      of DNA-binding proteins such as histones and transcription factors (TFs) upon 
      their interaction with particular regions of the genome. To examine the genomic 
      distribution of a TF in specific cell types in response to a change in nitrogen 
      concentration, we developed a micro-ChIP (μChIP) protocol that requires only 
      ~5000 Arabidopsis cells transiently expressing the Arabidopsis TF Basic Leucine 
      Zipper 1 (bZIP1) fused to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) domain that mediates 
      nuclear import in the presence of dexamethasone. The DNA fragments obtained from 
      the immunoprecipitation of bZIP1-DNA complexes were analyzed by next-generation 
      sequencing (ChIP-seq), which helped uncover genome-wide associations between a 
      bZIP1 and its targets in plant cells upon fluctuations in nitrogen availability.

AB  - ANAC069 encodes a plasma membrane-bound NAC protein that integrates auxin and 
      salt signals to regulate Arabidopsis thaliana seed germination. However, the 
      regulatory network of ANAC069 has not been revealed. Here, we report that ANAC069 
      is a direct target gene of the ATDOF5.8 transcription factor. There are seven DOF 
      motifs in the promoter of ANAC069, which is highly enriched in the promoter. 
      Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays showed that a Dof protein, ATDOF5.8, binds to the 
      DOF motifs. The interaction between ATDOF5.8 and the promoter of ANAC069 was 
      further confirmed by transient expression assays in tobacco leaves. Chromatin 
      Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) results suggested that the binding of ATDOF5.8 to DOF 
      motifs in the promoter of ANAC069 occurs in vivo in Arabidopsis to regulate the 
      expression of ANAC069. Moreover, ATDOF5.8 and ANAC069 share similar expression 
      patterns in response to salt, drought and ABA treatment. Taken together, the 
      results suggested a regulatory network model mediated by ANAC069, under abiotic 
      stress conditions, ATDOF5.8 regulates the expression of ANAC069, and the 
      activated ANAC069 binds to NAC recognition sequences or other motifs to regulate 
      the expression of genes containing these motifs in their promoters.

AB  - In rice, OsBBX14, a B-box (BBX) transcription factor, reportedly delays heading. 
      Here, we revealed that OsBBX14 positively regulates rice photomorphogenesis. The 
      OsBBX14-overexpressing (OsBBX14-OX) seedlings were hypersensitive to light, 
      especially blue light, and exhibited dwarfism, while the OsBBX14 knock-out plants 
      (osbbx14) were taller than wild-type plants under blue light. Histological 
      analyses indicated that the observed dwarfism was mainly due to decreased cell 
      length. Additionally, OsBBX14 abundance (mRNA and protein levels) was influenced 
      by different light wavelengths in a time-dependent manner. The expression levels 
      of HY5Ls (LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 LIKE) and ELIPs (EARLY LIGHT-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN) genes, 
      whose Arabidopsis thaliana homologs function as positive regulators in the light 
      signaling pathway, were significantly upregulated in OsBBX14-OX lines. In 
      contrast, the expression of genes related to cell wall organization and dwarfism 
      was downregulated in OsBBX14-OX lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
      assays confirmed that OsBBX14 binds to the T/G-box of HY5L1 (LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 
      LIKE 1) promoter. LUC complementation imaging (LCI) results suggested that 
      OsBBX14 had physical interaction with OsCRY2 protein. Collectively, in response 
      to blue light, OsBBX14 promotes photomorphogenesis, probably by directly or 
      indirectly regulating the expression of HY5L1 or other genes related to cell wall 
      organization and dwarfism.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in several processes including 
      control of gene expression. These RNAs function through binding to 
      histone-modifying complexes and transcriptional machinery including transcription 
      factor, mediator, and RNA polymerase II. We present methods for the discovery and 
      characterization of lncRNAs. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) is a modified version 
      of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and it is now generally used in lncRNA 
      study. The method allows for testing of lncRNA-protein interactions in vivo. RIP 
      assay facilitates the identification of consensus sequences of preferred binding 
      site for the RNA-binding protein under study, and identification of the binding 
      sites can provide valuable information on the possible mechanism by which the 
      RNA-binding protein functions.

TI  - Transcription Factor ANAC074 Binds to NRS1, NRS2, or MybSt1 Element in Addition 
      to the NACRS to Regulate Gene Expression.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19103271 [doi]
LID - 3271
AB  - NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors play important roles in many 
      biological processes, and mainly bind to the NACRS with core sequences "CACG" or 
      "CATGTG" to regulate gene expression. However, whether NAC proteins can bind to 
      other motifs without these core sequences remains unknown. In this study, we 
      employed a Transcription Factor-Centered Yeast one Hybrid (TF-Centered Y1H) 
      screen to study the motifs recognized by ANAC074. In addition to the NACRS core 
      cis-element, we identified that ANAC074 could bind to MybSt1, NRS1, and NRS2. Y1H 
      and GUS assays showed that ANAC074 could bind the promoters of ethylene 
      responsive genes and stress responsive genes via the NRS1, NRS2, or MybSt1 
      element. ChIP study further confirmed that the bindings of ANAC074 to MybSt1, 
      NRS1, and NRS2 actually occurred in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, ten NAC proteins 
      from different NAC subfamilies in Arabidopsis thaliana were selected and 
      confirmed to bind to the MybSt1, NRS1, and NRS2 motifs, indicating that they are 
      recognized commonly by NACs. These findings will help us to further reveal the 
      functions of NAC proteins.

TI  - Toward the identification and regulation of the Arabidopsis thaliana ABI3 
      regulon.
PG  - 8240-54
AB  - The plant-specific, B3 domain-containing transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID 
      INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) is an essential component of the regulatory network 
      controlling the development and maturation of the Arabidopsis thaliana seed. 
      Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip), transcriptome analysis, 
      quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and a transient 
      promoter activation assay have been combined to identify a set of 98 ABI3 target 
      genes. Most of these presumptive ABI3 targets require the presence of abscisic 
      acid for their activation and are specifically expressed during seed maturation. 
      ABI3 target promoters are enriched for G-box-like and RY-like elements. The 
      general occurrence of these cis motifs in non-ABI3 target promoters suggests the 
      existence of as yet unidentified regulatory signals, some of which may be 
      associated with epigenetic control. Several members of the ABI3 regulon are also 
      regulated by other transcription factors, including the seed-specific, B3 
      domain-containing FUS3 and LEC2. The data strengthen and extend the notion that 
      ABI3 is essential for the protection of embryonic structures from desiccation and 
      raise pertinent questions regarding the specificity of promoter recognition.

TI  - Tagging of MADS domain proteins for chromatin immunoprecipitation.
PG  - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most transcription factors fulfill their role in complexes and 
      regulate their target genes upon binding to DNA motifs located in upstream 
      regions or introns. To date, knowledge about transcription factor target genes 
      and their corresponding transcription factor binding sites are still very 
      limited. Two related methods that allow in vivo identification of transcription 
      factor binding sites are chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and chromatin 
      affinity purification (ChAP). For ChAP, the protein of interest is tagged with a 
      peptide or protein, which can be used for affinity purification of the 
      protein-DNA complex and hence, the identification of the target gene. RESULTS: 
      Here, we present the results of experiments aiming at the development of a 
      generic tagging approach for the Arabidopsis MADS domain proteins AGAMOUS, 
      SEPALLATA3, and FRUITFULL. For this, Arabidopsis wild type plants were 
      transformed with constructs containing a MADS-box gene fused to either a double 
      Strep-tag II-FLAG-tag, a triple HA-tag, or an eGFP-tag, all under the control of 
      the constitutive double 35S Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) promoter. Strikingly, 
      in all cases, the number of transformants with loss-of-function phenotypes was 
      much larger than those with an overexpression phenotype. Using endogenous 
      promoters in stead of the 35S CaMV resulted in a dramatic reduction in the 
      frequency of loss-of-function phenotypes. Furthermore, pleiotropic defects 
      occasionally caused by an overexpression strategy can be overcome by using the 
      native promoter of the gene. Finally, a ChAP result is presented using GFP 
      antibody on plants carrying a genomic fragment of a MADS-box gene fused to GFP. 
      CONCLUSION: This study revealed that MADS-box proteins are very sensitive to 
      fusions with small peptide tags and GFP tags. Furthermore, for the expression of 
      chimeric versions of MADS-box genes it is favorable to use the entire genomic 
      region in frame to the tag of choice. Interestingly, though unexpected, it 
      appears that the use of chimeric versions of MADS-box genes under the control of 
      the strong 35S CaMV promoter is a very efficient method to obtain 
      dominant-negative mutants, either caused by cosuppression or by alteration of the 
      activity of the recombinant protein. Finally, we were able to demonstrate AGAMOUS 
      binding to one of its targets by ChAP.

TI  - GmFULc Is Induced by Short Days in Soybean and May Accelerate Flowering in 
      Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana.
LID - 10.3390/ijms221910333 [doi]
LID - 10333
AB  - Flowering is an important developmental process from vegetative to reproductive 
      growth in plant; thus, it is necessary to analyze the genes involved in the 
      regulation of flowering time. The MADS-box transcription factor family exists 
      widely in plants and plays an important role in the regulation of flowering time. 
      However, the molecular mechanism of GmFULc involved in the regulation of plant 
      flowering is not very clear. In this study, GmFULc protein had a typical MADS 
      domain and it was a member of MADS-box transcription factor family. The 
      expression analysis revealed that GmFULc was induced by short days (SD) and 
      regulated by the circadian clock. Compared to wild type (WT), overexpression of 
      GmFULc in transgenic Arabidopsis caused significantly earlier flowering time, 
      while ful mutants flowered later, and overexpression of GmFULc rescued the 
      late-flowering phenotype of ful mutants. ChIP-seq of GmFULc binding sites 
      identified potential direct targets, including TOPLESS (TPL), and it inhibited 
      the transcriptional activity of TPL. In addition, the transcription levels of 
      FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) and 
      LEAFY (LFY) in the downstream of TPL were increased in 
      GmFULc-&nbsp;overexpressionArabidopsis, suggesting that the early flowering 
      phenotype was associated with up-regulation of these genes. Our results suggested 
      that GmFULc inhibited the transcriptional activity of TPL and induced expression 
      of FT, SOC1 and LFY to promote flowering.

TI  - Mutation of the imprinted gene OsEMF2a induces autonomous endosperm development 
      and delayed cellularization in rice.

AB  - In angiosperms, endosperm development comprises a series of developmental 
      transitions controlled by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that are initiated 
      after double fertilization. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a key 
      component of these mechanisms that mediate histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation 
      (H3K27me3); the action of PRC2 is well described in Arabidopsis thaliana but 
      remains uncertain in cereals. In this study, we demonstrate that mutation of the 
      rice (Oryza sativa) gene EMBRYONIC FLOWER2a (OsEMF2a), encoding a zinc-finger 
      containing component of PRC2, causes an autonomous endosperm phenotype involving 
      proliferation of the central cell nuclei with separate cytoplasmic domains, even 
      in the absence of fertilization. Detailed cytological and transcriptomic analyses 
      revealed that the autonomous endosperm can produce storage compounds, starch 
      granules, and protein bodies specific to the endosperm. These events have not 
      been reported in Arabidopsis. After fertilization, we observed an abnormally 
      delayed developmental transition in the endosperm. Transcriptome and H3K27me3 
      ChIP-seq analyses using endosperm from the emf2a mutant identified downstream 
      targets of PRC2. These included >100 transcription factor genes such as type-I 
      MADS-box genes, which are likely required for endosperm development. Our results 
      demonstrate that OsEMF2a-containing PRC2 controls endosperm developmental 
      programs before and after fertilization.

TI  - Redox-sensitive bZIP68 plays a role in balancing stress tolerance with growth in 
      Arabidopsis.
PG  - 768-783
LID - 10.1111/tpj.14476 [doi]
AB  - Perturbation of the cellular redox state by stress conditions is sensed by 
      redox-sensitive proteins so that the cell can physiologically respond to 
      stressors. However, the mechanisms linking sensing to response remain poorly 
      understood in plants. Here we report that the transcription factor bZIP68 
      underwent in vivo oxidation in Arabidopsis cells under oxidative stress which is 
      dependent on its redox-sensitive Cys320 residue. bZIP68 is primarily localized to 
      the nucleus under normal growth conditions in Arabidopsis seedlings. Oxidative 
      stress reduces its accumulation in the nucleus and increases its cytosolic 
      localization. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) 
      revealed that bZIP68 primarily binds to promoter regions containing the core 
      G-box (CACGTG) or G-box-like motif of the genes involved in abiotic and biotic 
      stress responses, photosynthesis, biosynthetic processes, and transcriptional 
      regulation. The bzip68 mutant displayed slower growth under normal conditions but 
      enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress. The results from the ChIP-seq and 
      phenotypic and transcriptome comparison between the bzip68 mutant and wildtype 
      indicate that bZIP68 normally suppresses expression of stress tolerance genes and 
      promotes expression of growth-related genes, whereas its inactivation enhances 
      stress tolerance but suppresses growth. bZIP68 might balance stress tolerance 
      with growth through the extent of its oxidative inactivation according to the 
      environment.

TI  - FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 activates SEPALLATA2 but inhibits CLAVATA3 to 
      regulate meristem determinacy and maintenance in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 9375-80
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1602960113 [doi]
AB  - Plant meristems are responsible for the generation of all plant tissues and 
      organs. Here we show that the transcription factor (TF) FAR-RED ELONGATED 
      HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) plays an important role in both floral meristem (FM) 
      determinacy and shoot apical meristem maintenance in Arabidopsis, in addition to 
      its well-known multifaceted roles in plant growth and development during the 
      vegetative stage. Through genetic analyses, we show that WUSCHEL (WUS) and 
      CLAVATA3 (CLV3), two central players in the establishment and maintenance of 
      meristems, are epistatic to FHY3 Using genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, we 
      identify hundreds of FHY3 target genes in flowers and find that FHY3 mainly acts 
      as a transcriptional repressor in flower development, in contrast to its 
      transcriptional activator role in seedlings. Binding motif-enrichment analyses 
      indicate that FHY3 may coregulate flower development with three flower-specific 
      MADS-domain TFs and four basic helix-loop-helix TFs that are involved in 
      photomorphogenesis. We further demonstrate that CLV3, SEPALLATA1 (SEP1), and SEP2 
      are FHY3 target genes. In shoot apical meristem, FHY3 directly represses CLV3, 
      which consequently regulates WUS to maintain the stem cell pool. Intriguingly, 
      CLV3 expression did not change significantly in fhy3 and phytochrome B mutants 
      before and after light treatment, indicating that FHY3 and phytochrome B are 
      involved in light-regulated meristem activity. In FM, FHY3 directly represses 
      CLV3, but activates SEP2, to ultimately promote FM determinacy. Taken together, 
      our results reveal insights into the mechanisms of meristem maintenance and 
      determinacy, and illustrate how the roles of a single TF may vary in different 
      organs and developmental stages.

TI  - Genome-wide identification of CCA1 targets uncovers an expanded clock network in 
      Arabidopsis.
PG  - E4802-10

AB  - The circadian clock in Arabidopsis exerts a critical role in timing multiple 
      biological processes and stress responses through the regulation of up to 80% of 
      the transcriptome. As a key component of the clock, the Myb-like transcription 
      factor CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) is able to initiate and set the phase 
      of clock-controlled rhythms and has been shown to regulate gene expression by 
      binding directly to the evening element (EE) motif found in target gene 
      promoters. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying clock regulation 
      of the rhythmic transcriptome, specifically how clock components connect to clock 
      output pathways, is poorly understood. In this study, using ChIP followed by deep 
      sequencing of CCA1 in constant light (LL) and diel (LD) conditions, more than 
      1,000 genomic regions occupied by CCA1 were identified. CCA1 targets are enriched 
      for a myriad of biological processes and stress responses, providing direct links 
      to clock-controlled pathways and suggesting that CCA1 plays an important role in 
      regulating a large subset of the rhythmic transcriptome. Although many of these 
      target genes are evening expressed and contain the EE motif, a significant subset 
      is morning phased and enriched for previously unrecognized motifs associated with 
      CCA1 function. Furthermore, this work revealed several CCA1 targets that do not 
      cycle in either LL or LD conditions. Together, our results emphasize an expanded 
      role for the clock in regulating a diverse category of genes and key pathways in 
      Arabidopsis and provide a comprehensive resource for future functional studies.

AB  - The expression profile chip of the wheat salt-tolerant mutant RH8706-49 was 
      investigated under salt stress in our laboratory. Results revealed a novel gene 
      induced by salt stress with unknown functions. The gene was named as TaZNF 
      (Triticum aestivum predicted Dof zinc finger protein) because it contains the 
      zf-Dof superfamily and was deposited in GenBank (accession no. KF307327). Further 
      analysis showed that TaZNF significantly improved the salt-tolerance of 
      transgenic Arabidopsis. Various physiological indices of the transgenic plant 
      were improved compared with those of the control after salt stress. Non-invasive 
      micro-test (NMT) detection showed that the root tip of transgenic Arabidopsis 
      significantly expressed Na(+) excretion. TaZNF is mainly localized in the nucleus 
      and exhibited transcriptional activity. Hence, this protein was considered a 
      transcription factor. The TaZNF upstream promoter was then cloned and was found 
      to contain three salts, one jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA), and several 
      ABA-responsive elements. The GUS staining and quantitative results of different 
      tissues in the full-length promoter in the transgenic plants showed that the 
      promoter was not tissue specific. The promoter activity in the root, leaf, and 
      flower was enhanced after induction by salt stress. Moreover, GUS staining and 
      quantitative measurement of GUS activity showed that the promoter sequence 
      contained the positive regulatory element of salt and MeJA after their respective 
      elements were mutated in the full-length promoter. RNA-Seq result showed that 
      2727 genes were differentially expressed; most of these genes were involved in 
      the metabolic pathway and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite pathway.

TI  - Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-Dependent AtSR1/CAMTA3 Plays Critical Roles in Balancing Plant 
      Growth and Immunity.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19061764 [doi]
LID - 1764
AB  - During plant-pathogen interactions, plants have to relocate their resources 
      including energy to defend invading organisms; as a result, plant growth and 
      development are usually reduced. Arabidopsis signal responsive1 (AtSR1) has been 
      documented as a negative regulator of plant immune responses and could serve as a 
      positive regulator of plant growth and development. However, the mechanism by 
      which AtSR1 balances plant growth and immunity is poorly understood. Here, we 
      performed a global gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays to 
      study how AtSR1 regulates defense- and growth-related genes in plants with and 
      without bacterial pathogen infection. Results revealed that AtSR1 negatively 
      regulates most of the immune-related genes involved in molecular 
      pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), effector-triggered immunity (ETI), and in 
      salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonate (JA)-mediated signaling pathways. AtSR1 may 
      rigidly regulate several steps of the SA-mediated pathway, from the activation of 
      SA synthesis to the perception of SA signal. Furthermore, AtSR1 may also regulate 
      plant growth through its involvement in regulating auxin- and BRs-related 
      pathways. Although microarray data revealed that expression levels of 
      defense-related genes induced by pathogens are higher in wild-type (WT) plants 
      than that in atsr1 mutant plants, WT plants are more susceptible to the infection 
      of virulent pathogen as compared to atsr1 mutant plants. These observations 
      indicate that the AtSR1 functions in suppressing the expression of genes induced 
      by pathogen attack and contributes to the rapid establishment of resistance in WT 
      background. Results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR assays suggest that AtSR1 acts as transcription 
      factor in balancing plant growth and immunity, through interaction with the 
      “CGCG” containing CG-box in the promotors of its target genes.

AB  - Transcription factors are a main component of gene regulation as they activate or 
      repress gene expression by binding to specific binding sites in promoters. The 
      de-novo discovery of transcription factor binding sites in target regions 
      obtained by wet-lab experiments is a challenging problem in computational 
      biology, which has not been fully solved yet. Here, we present a de-novo motif 
      discovery tool called Dispom for finding differentially abundant transcription 
      factor binding sites that models existing positional preferences of binding sites 
      and adjusts the length of the motif in the learning process. Evaluating Dispom, 
      we find that its prediction performance is superior to existing tools for de-novo 
      motif discovery for 18 benchmark data sets with planted binding sites, and for a 
      metazoan compendium based on experimental data from micro-array, ChIP-chip, 
      ChIP-DSL, and DamID as well as Gene Ontology data. Finally, we apply Dispom to 
      find binding sites differentially abundant in promoters of auxin-responsive genes 
      extracted from Arabidopsis thaliana microarray data, and we find a motif that can 
      be interpreted as a refined auxin responsive element predominately positioned in 
      the 250-bp region upstream of the transcription start site. Using an independent 
      data set of auxin-responsive genes, we find in genome-wide predictions that the 
      refined motif is more specific for auxin-responsive genes than the canonical 
      auxin-responsive element. In general, Dispom can be used to find differentially 
      abundant motifs in sequences of any origin. However, the positional distribution 
      learned by Dispom is especially beneficial if all sequences are aligned to some 
      anchor point like the transcription start site in case of promoter sequences. We 
      demonstrate that the combination of searching for differentially abundant motifs 
      and inferring a position distribution from the data is beneficial for de-novo 
      motif discovery. Hence, we make the tool freely available as a component of the 
      open-source Java framework Jstacs and as a stand-alone application at 
      http://www.jstacs.de/index.php/Dispom.

      purification followed by sequencing (DAP-seq) or chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). Unlike previous methods based on the two-step 
      prediction of cis-motifs and DNA-element-binding TFs, our EAT-UpTF analysis 
      enabled a one-step identification of enriched upstream TFs in a set of GOIs using 
      lists of empirically determined TF-target genes. The tool is designed 
      particularly for plant researches, due to the lack of analytic tools for upstream 
      TF enrichment, and available at https://github.com/sangreashim/EAT-UpTF and

TI  - EIN3 and ORE1 Accelerate Degreening during Ethylene-Mediated Leaf Senescence by 
      Directly Activating Chlorophyll Catabolic Genes in Arabidopsis.
PG  - e1005399
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005399 [doi]
LID - e1005399
AB  - Degreening, caused by chlorophyll degradation, is the most obvious symptom of 
      senescing leaves. Chlorophyll degradation can be triggered by endogenous and 
      environmental cues, and ethylene is one of the major inducers. ETHYLENE 
      INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) is a key transcription factor in the ethylene signaling 
      pathway. It was previously reported that EIN3, miR164, and a NAC (NAM, ATAF, and 
      CUC) transcription factor ORE1/NAC2 constitute a regulatory network mediating 
      leaf senescence. However, how this network regulates chlorophyll degradation at 
      molecular level is not yet elucidated. Here we report a feed-forward regulation 
      of chlorophyll degradation that involves EIN3, ORE1, and chlorophyll catabolic 
      genes (CCGs). Gene expression analysis showed that the induction of three major 
      CCGs, NYE1, NYC1 and PAO, by ethylene was largely repressed in ein3 eil1 double 
      mutant. Dual-luciferase assay revealed that EIN3 significantly enhanced the 
      promoter activity of NYE1, NYC1 and PAO in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Furthermore, 
      Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that EIN3 could directly 
      bind to NYE1, NYC1 and PAO promoters. These results reveal that EIN3 functions as 
      a positive regulator of CCG expression during ethylene-mediated chlorophyll 
      degradation. Interestingly, ORE1, a senescence regulator which is a downstream 
      target of EIN3, could also activate the expression of NYE1, NYC1 and PAO by 
      directly binding to their promoters in EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      (ChIP) assays. In addition, EIN3 and ORE1 promoted NYE1 and NYC1 transcriptions 
      in an additive manner. These results suggest that ORE1 is also involved in the 
      direct regulation of CCG transcription. Moreover, ORE1 activated the expression 
      of ACS2, a major ethylene biosynthesis gene, and subsequently promoted ethylene 
      production. Collectively, our work reveals that EIN3, ORE1 and CCGs constitute a 
      coherent feed-forward loop involving in the robust regulation of 
      ethylene-mediated chlorophyll degradation during leaf senescence in Arabidopsis.

TI  - MYB106 is a negative regulator and a substrate for CRL3(BPM) E3 ligase in 
      regulating flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 1104-1119
LID - 10.1111/jipb.13071 [doi]
AB  - Flowering time is crucial for successful reproduction in plants, the onset and 
      progression of which are strictly controlled. However, flowering time is a 
      complex and environmentally responsive history trait and the underlying 
      mechanisms still need to be fully characterized. Post-translational regulation of 
      the activities of transcription factors (TFs) is a dynamic and essential 
      mechanism for plant growth and development. CRL3(BPM) E3 ligase is a 
      CULLIN3-based E3 ligase involved in orchestrating protein stability via the 
      ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Our study shows that the mutation of MYB106 induced 
      early flowering phenotype while over-expression of MYB106 delayed Arabidopsis 
      flowering. Transcriptome analysis of myb106 mutants reveals 257 differentially 
      expressed genes between wild type and myb106-1 mutants, including Flowering Locus 
      T (FT) which is related to flowering time. Moreover, in vitro electrophoretic 
      mobility shift assays (EMSA), in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) assays and dual luciferase assays 
      demonstrate that MYB106 directly binds to the promoter of FT to suppress its 
      expression. Furthermore, we confirm that MYB106 interacts with BPM proteins which 
      are further identified by CRL3(BPM) E3 ligases as the substrate. Taken together, 
      we have identified MYB106 as a negative regulator in the control of flowering 
      time and a new substrate for CRL3(BPM) E3 ligases in Arabidopsis.

TI  - OsNAC2 encoding a NAC transcription factor that affects plant height through 
      mediating the gibberellic acid pathway in rice.
PG  - 302-14
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12819 [doi]
AB  - Plant height and flowering time are key agronomic traits affecting yield in rice 
      (Oryza sativa). In this study, we investigated the functions in rice growth and 
      development of OsNAC2, encoding a NAC transcription factor in rice. Transgenic 
      plants that constitutively expressed OsNAC2 had shorter internodes, shorter 
      spikelets, and were more insensitive to gibberellic acid (GA(3)). In addition, 
      the levels of GAs decreased in OsNAC2 overexpression plants, compared with the 
      wild-type. Moreover, flowering was delayed for approximately 5 days in transgenic 
      lines. The transcription of Hd3a, a flowering-time related gene, was suppressed 
      in transgenic lines. In addition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing OsNAC2 
      were also more insensitive to GA(3). The expression levels of GA biosynthetic 
      genes OsKO2 and OsKAO were repressed. The expression of OsSLRL, encoding a 
      repressor in the GA signal pathway, and OsEATB, which encodes a repressor of GA 
      biosynthesis, were both enhanced. Western blotting indicated that DELLA also 
      accumulated at the protein level. Dual-luciferase reporter analyses, yeast 
      one-hybrid assays and ChIP-qPCR suggested that OsNAC2 directly interacted with 
      the promoter of OsEATB and OsKO2. Taken together, we proposed that OsNAC2 is a 
      negative regulator of the plant height and flowering time, which acts by directly 
      regulating key genes of the GA pathway in rice.

TI  - SIG1, a sigma factor for the chloroplast RNA polymerase, differently associates 
      with multiple DNA regions in the chloroplast chromosomes in vivo.
PG  - 12182-94
LID - 10.3390/ijms131012182 [doi]
AB  - Chloroplasts have their own DNA and gene expression systems. Transcription in 
      chloroplasts is regulated by two types of RNA polymerase, nuclear-encoded plastid 
      RNA polymerase (NEP) and plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (PEP), and 
      multiple sigma factors for PEP. To study transcriptional regulation in 
      chloroplasts, a molecular genetic approach has extensively been used. However, 
      this method may include indirect effects, and it cannot be applied to the 
      analysis of factors essential to survival. These limitations make understanding 
      specific regulation by transcription factors difficult. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a powerful and useful tool for obtaining 
      information on transcription-factor binding sites; it can directly detect dynamic 
      changes in their interaction patterns in vivo. To further understand 
      transcriptional regulation in chloroplasts, we here established a ChIP-based 
      method in Arabidopsis thaliana and analyzed the binding pattern of a chloroplast 
      sigma factor, SIG1. We found that SIG1 specifically binds to newly identified 
      target promoters as well as to a set of promoters of genes whose mRNA expression 
      is dependent on OsSIG1 in rice and that this binding changed in response to 
      high-light stress. These results suggested that the ChIP-based approach is very 
      useful in understanding transcriptional regulation of chloroplast genes and can 
      overcome several problems posed by conventional methods.

TI  - TGA class II transcription factors are essential to restrict oxidative stress in 
      response to UV-B stress in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1891-1905

AB  - Plants possess a robust metabolic network for sensing and controlling reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) levels upon stress conditions. Evidence shown here supports 
      a role for TGA class II transcription factors as critical regulators of genes 
      controlling ROS levels in the tolerance response to UV-B stress in Arabidopsis. 
      First, tga256 mutant plants showed reduced capacity to scavenge H2O2 and restrict 
      oxidative damage in response to UV-B, and also to methylviologen-induced 
      photooxidative stress. The TGA2 transgene (tga256/TGA2 plants) complemented these 
      phenotypes. Second, RNAseq followed by clustering and Gene Ontology term analyses 
      indicate that TGA2/5/6 positively control the UV-B-induced expression of a group 
      of genes with oxidoreductase, glutathione transferase, and glucosyltransferase 
      activities, such as members of the glutathione S-transferase Tau subfamily 
      (GSTU), which encodes peroxide-scavenging enzymes. Accordingly, increased 
      glutathione peroxidase activity triggered by UV-B was impaired in tga256 mutants. 
      Third, the function of TGA2/5/6 as transcriptional activators of GSTU genes in 
      the UV-B response was confirmed for GSTU7, GSTU8, and GSTU25, using quantitative 
      reverse transcription-PCR and ChIP analyses. Fourth, expression of the GSTU7 
      transgene complemented the UV-B-susceptible phenotype of tga256 mutant plants. 
      Together, this evidence indicates that TGA2/5/6 factors are key regulators of the 
      antioxidant/detoxifying response to an abiotic stress such as UV-B light 
      overexposure.

TI  - Epigenetic control of a transcription factor at the cross section of two 
      antagonistic pathways.
PG  - 106-13
AB  - The expression of the Arabidopsis gene WRKY70 is known to be antagonistically 
      regulated by the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways. 
      The gene encodes a transcription factor functioning at the crossroad of the two 
      pathways. Here we show that the Arabidopsis homolog of Trithorax, ATX1, activates 
      the expression of the WRKY70 gene and is involved in establishing the 
      trimethylation pattern of histone H3 tail lysine 4 (H3K4me3) residues of its 
      nucleosomes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses with antiATX1 specific 
      antibodies demonstrated that WRKY70 is a primary target for the ATX1 histone 
      methylase activity, while the SA-responsive gene, PR1, and the JA-responsive 
      gene, THI2.1, are secondary targets. The unexpected finding that PR1 and THI2.1 
      nucleosomes carryH3K4me3-marks unrelated to their transcription states suggests 
      that the defense-response genes PR1 and THI2.1 keep their nucleosomes in 
      'actively' modified state, perhaps, in preparation for quick-changes of 
      transcription when needed by the cell. Based on the experimental data, we propose 
      a model that could explain the ability of a single epigenetic factor to 
      orchestrate expression of a large number of genes, particularly in cases 
      involving response reactions.

TI  - Utilizing gene pair orientations for HMM-based analysis of promoter array 
      ChIP-chip data.
PG  - 2118-25
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp276 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Array-based analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) 
      data is a powerful technique for identifying DNA target regions of individual 
      transcription factors. The identification of these target regions from 
      comprehensive promoter array ChIP-chip data is challenging. Here, three 
      approaches for the identification of transcription factor target genes from 
      promoter array ChIP-chip data are presented. We compare (i) a standard 
      log-fold-change analysis (LFC); (ii) a basic method based on a Hidden Markov 
      Model (HMM); and (iii) a new extension of the HMM approach to an HMM with scaled 
      transition matrices (SHMM) that incorporates information about the relative 
      orientation of adjacent gene pairs on DNA. RESULTS: All three methods are applied 
      to different promoter array ChIP-chip datasets of the yeast Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae and the important model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to compare the 
      prediction of transcription factor target genes. In the context of the yeast cell 
      cycle, common target genes bound by the transcription factors ACE2 and SWI5, and 
      ACE2 and FKH2 are identified and evaluated using the Saccharomyces Genome 
      Database. Regarding A.thaliana, target genes of the seed-specific transcription 
      factor ABI3 are predicted and evaluate based on publicly available gene 
      expression profiles and transient assays performed in the wet laboratory 
      experiments. The application of the novel SHMM to these two different promoter 
      array ChIP-chip datasets leads to an improved identification of transcription 
      factor target genes in comparison to the two standard approaches LFC and HMM. 
      AVAILABILITY: The software of LFC, HMM and SHMM, the ABI3 ChIP-chip dataset, and 
      Supplementary Material can be downloaded from

TI  - GCN5 modulates trichome initiation in Arabidopsis by manipulating histone 
      acetylation of core trichome initiation regulator genes.
PG  - 755-765
LID - 10.1007/s00299-019-02404-2 [doi]
AB  - Histone acetyltransferase GCN5 affects trichome initiation via mediating the 
      expression of some core trichome initiation regulator genes in Arabidopsis. 
      GENERAL CONTROL NON-REPRESSED PROTEIN5 (GCN5), a histone acetyltransferase 
      involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, organ development, secondary 
      metabolism, and plant responses to abiotic stresses, has recently been shown to 
      modulate trichome branching in Arabidopsis. Here, we provide evidence that GCN5 
      is also involved in the regulation of trichome initiation. We found that mutation 
      of GCN5 led to increased leaf trichome density in Arabidopsis. Quantitative 
      RT-PCR results showed that the expression of CPC, GL1, GL2, and GL3, four 
      well-known core trichome initiation regulator genes, was decreased in the gcn5 
      mutants. ChIP assays indicated that these four trichome initiation regulator 
      genes are direct targets of GCN5. Consistent with these results, GCN5-mediated 
      H3K14/K9 acetylation levels on the TSS regions of these genes were decreased. On 
      the other hand, leaf trichome density was reduced in plants overexpressing GCN5, 
      and both the transcript levels and GCN5-binding enrichments of CPC, GL1, GL2, and 
      GL3 genes were elevated. Taken together, these data suggests that GCN5 affects 
      trichome initiation by modulating the transcription activities of trichome 
      initiation regulator genes via H3K9/14 acetylation.

TI  - ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 4 negatively regulates flowering through directly 
      promoting Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C transcription.
PG  - 195-205
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erv459 [doi]
AB  - During the life cycle of a plant, one of the major biological processes is the 
      transition from the vegetative to the reproductive stage. In Arabidopsis, 
      flowering time is precisely controlled by extensive environmental and internal 
      cues. Gibberellins (GAs) promote flowering, while abscisic acid (ABA) is 
      considered as a flowering suppressor. However, the detailed mechanism through 
      which ABA inhibits the floral transition is poorly understood. Here, we report 
      that ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4), a key component in the ABA signalling 
      pathway, negatively regulates floral transition by directly promoting FLOWERING 
      LOCUS C (FLC) transcription. The abi4 mutant showed the early flowering phenotype 
      whereas ABI4-overexpressing (OE-ABI4) plants had delayed floral transition. 
      Consistently, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed 
      that the FLC transcription level was down-regulated in abi4, but up-regulated in 
      OE-ABI4. The change in FT level was consistent with the pattern of FLC 
      expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR), electrophoretic 
      mobility shift assay (EMSA), and tobacco transient expression analysis showed 
      that ABI4 promotes FLC expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic 
      analysis demonstrated that OE-ABI4::flc-3 could not alter the flc-3 phenotype. 
      OE-FLC::abi4 showed a markedly delayed flowering phenotype, which mimicked 
      OE-FLC::WT, and suggested that ABI4 acts upstream of FLC in the same genetic 
      pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that ABA inhibits the floral 
      transition by activating FLC transcription through ABI4.

TI  - The distribution and evolution of Arabidopsis thaliana cis natural antisense 
      transcripts.
PG  - 444

AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are regulatory RNAs that contain 
      sequence complementary to other RNAs, these other RNAs usually being messenger 
      RNAs. In eukaryotic genomes, cis-NATs overlap the gene they complement. RESULTS: 
      Here, our goal is to analyze the distribution and evolutionary conservation of 
      cis-NATs for a variety of available data sets for Arabidopsis thaliana, to gain 
      insights into cis-NAT functional mechanisms and their significance. Cis-NATs 
      derived from traditional sequencing are largely validated by other data sets, 
      although different cis-NAT data sets have different prevalent cis-NAT topologies 
      with respect to overlapping protein-coding genes. A. thaliana cis-NATs have 
      substantial conservation (28-35% in the three substantive data sets analyzed) of 
      expression in A. lyrata. We examined evolutionary sequence conservation at 
      cis-NAT loci in Arabidopsis thaliana across nine sequenced Brassicaceae species 
      (picked for optimal discernment of purifying selection), focussing on the parts 
      of their sequences not overlapping protein-coding transcripts (dubbed 'NOLPs'). 
      We found significant NOLP sequence conservation for 28-34% NATs across different 
      cis-NAT sets. This NAT NOLP sequence conservation versus A. lyrata is generally 
      significantly correlated with conservation of expression. We discover a 
      significant enrichment of transcription factor binding sites (as evidenced by 
      CHIP-seq data) in NOLPs compared to randomly sampled near-gene NOLP-like DNA , 
      that is linked to significant sequence conservation. Conversely, there is no such 
      evidence for a general significant link between NOLPs and formation of small 
      interfering RNAs (siRNAs), with the substantial majority of unique siRNAs arising 
      from the overlapping portions of the cis-NATs. CONCLUSIONS: In aggregate, our 
      results suggest that many cis-NAT NOLPs function in the regulation of conserved 
      promoter/regulatory elements that they 'over-hang'.

TI  - WRKY46 functions as a transcriptional repressor of ALMT1, regulating 
      aluminum-induced malate secretion in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 825-35
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12337 [doi]
AB  - Aluminum (Al) toxicity is the major limiting factor for crop production on acid 
      soils, but the transcriptional regulation of Al tolerance genes is largely 
      unknown. Here, we found that the expression of a WRKY domain-containing 
      transcription factor WRKY46 is inhibited by Al and expressed in root stele, 
      whereas the expression of ALMT1, which encodes a malate efflux transporter, is 
      induced by Al stress and spatially co-localized with WRKY46 in root stele, 
      indicating the possible interaction between WRKY46 and ALMT1 in Arabidopsis. 
      Mutation of WRKY46 by T-DNA insertion leads to better root growth under Al 
      stress, and lower root Al content compared with the wild-type Col-0. The wrky46 
      mutant shows increased root malate secretion, which is consistent with the higher 
      ALMT1 expression in the mutant. Transient expression analysis using truncated 
      promoter of ALMT1 showed that ALMT1 expression can be inhibited by WRKY46 in 
      tobacco leaves. The yeast one-hybrid assay and ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed that 
      WRKY46 directly binds to ALMT1 promoter through specific W-boxes. Taken together, 
      we demonstrated that WRKY46 is a negative regulator of ALMT1, mutation of WRKY46 
      leads to increased malate secretion and reduced Al accumulation in root apices, 
      and thus confers higher Al resistance.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of genes targeted by PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE5 
      during seed germination in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 403-19
LID - 10.1105/tpc.108.064691 [doi]
AB  - PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE5 (PIL5) is a basic helix-loop-helix 
      transcription factor that inhibits seed germination by regulating the expression 
      of gibberellin (GA)- and abscisic acid (ABA)-related genes either directly or 
      indirectly. It is not yet known, however, whether PIL5 regulates seed germination 
      solely through GA and ABA. Here, we used Chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip 
      (ChIP-chip) analysis to identify 748 novel PIL5 binding sites in the Arabidopsis 
      thaliana genome. Consistent with the molecular function of PIL5 as a 
      transcription regulator, most of the identified binding sites are located in gene 
      promoter regions. Binding site analysis shows that PIL5 binds to its target sites 
      mainly through the G-box motif in vivo. Microarray analysis reveals that 
      phytochromes regulate a large number of genes mainly through PIL5 during seed 
      germination. Comparison between the ChIP-chip and microarray data indicates that 
      PIL5 regulates 166 genes by directly binding to their promoters. Many of the 
      identified genes encode transcription regulators involved in hormone signaling, 
      while some encode enzymes involved in cell wall modification. Interestingly, PIL5 
      directly regulates many transcription regulators of hormone signaling and 
      indirectly regulates many genes involved in hormone metabolism. Taken together, 
      our data indicate that PIL5 inhibits seed germination not just through GA and 
      ABA, but also by coordinating hormone signals and modulating cell wall properties 
      in imbibed seeds.

AB  - Unlike the situation in animals, the final morphology of the plant body is highly 
      modulated by the environment. During Arabidopsis development, intrinsic factors 
      provide the framework for basic patterning processes. CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN 
      LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIPIII) transcription factors are involved in embryo, shoot 
      and root patterning. During vegetative growth HD-ZIPIII proteins control several 
      polarity set-up processes such as in leaves and the vascular system. We have 
      identified several direct target genes of the HD-ZIPIII transcription factor 
      REVOLUTA (REV) using a chromatin immunoprecipitation/DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) 
      approach. This analysis revealed that REV acts upstream of auxin biosynthesis and 
      affects directly the expression of several class II HD-ZIP transcription factors 
      that have been shown to act in the shade-avoidance response pathway. We show 
      that, as well as involvement in basic patterning, HD-ZIPIII transcription factors 
      have a critical role in the control of the elongation growth that is induced when 
      plants experience shade. Leaf polarity is established by the opposed actions of 
      HD-ZIPIII and KANADI transcription factors. Finally, our study reveals that the 
      module that consists of HD-ZIPIII/KANADI transcription factors controls shade 
      growth antagonistically and that this antagonism is manifested in the opposed 
      regulation of shared target genes.

AB  - Regulation of iron uptake and use is critical for plant survival and growth. We 
      isolated an MYB gene from Malus xiaojinensis named MxMYB1, which is induced under 
      Fe-deficient conditions. Expression of MxMYB1 was upregulated by Fe starvation in 
      the roots but not in leaves, suggesting that MxMYB1 might play a role in iron 
      nutrition in roots. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing MxMYB1 exhibited 
      lower iron content as compared with wild type plants under both Fe-normal (40 
      microM) and Fe-deficient conditions (Fe omitted and Ferrozine 300 microM). 
      However, the contents of Cu, Zn and Mn were not changed in these transgenic 
      plants. Gene chip and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that 
      the expression of two Fe-related genes encoding an iron transporter AtIRT1 and an 
      iron storage protein ferritin AtFER1 might be negatively regulated by MxMYB1 as 
      the expression levels of these genes were lower in MxMYB1 expressing transgenic 
      Arabidopsis plants as compared with wild type plants under both Fe-normal and 
      Fe-deficient conditions. These results suggest that MxMYB1 may function as a 
      negative regulator of iron uptake and storage in plants.

TI  - Arabidopsis MYB30 is a direct target of BES1 and cooperates with BES1 to regulate 
      brassinosteroid-induced gene expression.
PG  - 275-86

AB  - A paradox of plant hormone biology is how a single small molecule can affect a 
      diverse array of growth and developmental processes. For instance, 
      brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate cell elongation, vascular differentiation, 
      senescence and stress responses. BRs signal through the BES1/BZR1 
      (bri1-Ethylmethane Sulphonate suppressor 1/brassinazole-resistant 1) family of 
      transcription factors, which regulate hundreds of target genes involved in this 
      pathway, yet little is known of this transcriptional network. Through microarray 
      and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, we identified a direct 
      target gene of BES1, AtMYB30, which encodes an MYB family transcription factor. 
      AtMYB30 null mutants display decreased BR responses and enhance the dwarf 
      phenotype of a weak allele of the BR receptor mutant bri1. Many BR-regulated 
      genes have reduced expression and/or hormone-induction in AtMYB30 mutants, 
      indicating that AtMYB30 functions to promote expression of a subset of BR target 
      genes. AtMYB30 and BES1 bind to a conserved MYB-binding site and E-box sequences, 
      respectively, in the promoters of genes that are regulated by both BRs and 
      AtMYB30. Finally, AtMYB30 and BES1 interact with each other both in vitro and in 
      vivo. These results demonstrate that BES1 and AtMYB30 function cooperatively to 
      promote BR target gene expression. Our results therefore establish a new 
      mechanism by which AtMYB30, a direct target of BES1, functions to amplify BR 
      signaling by helping BES1 activate downstream target genes.

AB  - Spatial and temporal control of cell growth is central for the morphogenesis of 
      multicellular organisms. For some cell types that undergo extensive post-mitotic 
      cell growth, such as neurons and hair cells, orchestrating the extent of 
      post-mitotic cell growth with development is vital for their physiology and 
      function. Previous studies suggested that the extent of cell growth is linked 
      with an increase in ploidy by endoreduplication but how developmental signals 
      control endocycling and cell growth is not understood in both animals and plants. 
      In this study we show that a trihelix transcription factor, GT2-LIKE 1 (GTL1), 
      actively terminates ploidy-dependent cell growth and its developmentally 
      regulated expression is one of the key determinants of cell size in Arabidopsis 
      leaf hair cells (trichomes). Through genome-wide chromatin-binding studies 
      (ChIP-chip) coupled with transcriptional profiling, we further demonstrate that 
      GTL1 directly represses the transcription of CDH1/FZR/CCS52, an activator of the 
      anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), to stop the endocycle progression 
      and ploidy-dependent cell growth. Thus, our findings uncover a previously 
      uncharacterised key molecular link between developmental programming and 
      cell-size control, highlighting the central role of APC/C in post-mitotic cell 
      growth.

AB  - Efficient de novo motif discovery from the results of wide-genome mapping of 
      transcription factor binding sites (ChIP-seq) is dependent on the choice of 
      background nucleotide sequences. The foreground sequences (ChIP-seq peaks) 
      represent not only specific motifs of target transcription factors, but also the 
      motifs overrepresented throughout the genome, such as simple sequence repeats. We 
      performed a massive comparison of the 'synthetic' and 'genomic' approaches to 
      generate background sequences for de novo motif discovery. The 'synthetic' 
      approach shuffled nucleotides in peaks, while in the 'genomic' approach selected 
      sequences from the reference genome randomly or only from gene promoters 
      according to the fraction of A/T nucleotides in each sequence. We compiled the 
      benchmark collections of ChIP-seq datasets for mouse, human and Arabidopsis, and 
      performed de novo motif discovery. We showed that the genomic approach has both 
      more robust detection of the known motifs of target transcription factors and 
      more stringent exclusion of the simple sequence repeats as possible non-specific 
      motifs. The advantage of the genomic approach over the synthetic approach was 
      greater in plants compared to mammals. We developed the AntiNoise web service 
      (https://denovosea.icgbio.ru/antinoise/) that implements a genomic approach to 
      extract genomic background sequences for twelve eukaryotic genomes.

TI  - Rice ABI5-Like1 regulates abscisic acid and auxin responses by affecting the

PG  - 1397-409
LID - 10.1104/pp.111.173427 [doi]
AB  - Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates plant development and is crucial for plant 
      responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Studies have identified the key 
      components of ABA signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), some of which 
      regulate ABA responses by the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes. 
      Here, we report the functional identification of rice (Oryza sativa) ABI5-Like1 
      (ABL1), which is a basic region/leucine zipper motif transcription factor. ABL1 
      is expressed in various tissues and is induced by the hormones ABA and 
      indole-3-acetic acid and stress conditions including salinity, drought, and 
      osmotic pressure. The ABL1 deficiency mutant, abl1, shows suppressed ABA 
      responses, and ABL1 expression in the Arabidopsis abi5 mutant rescued the ABA 
      sensitivity. The ABL1 protein is localized to the nucleus and can directly bind 
      ABA-responsive elements (ABREs; G-box) in vitro. A gene expression analysis by 
      DNA chip hybridization confirms that a large proportion of down-regulated genes 
      of abl1 are involved in stress responses, consistent with the transcriptional 
      activating effects of ABL1. Further studies indicate that ABL1 regulates the 
      plant stress responses by regulating a series of ABRE-containing WRKY family 
      genes. In addition, the abl1 mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous 
      indole-3-acetic acid, and some ABRE-containing genes related to auxin metabolism 
      or signaling are altered under ABL1 deficiency, suggesting that ABL1 modulates 
      ABA and auxin responses by directly regulating the ABRE-containing genes.

TI  - Brassinosteroids can regulate cellulose biosynthesis by controlling the 
      expression of CESA genes in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 4495-506
LID - 10.1093/jxb/err164 [doi]
AB  - The phytohormones, brassinosteroids (BRs), play important roles in regulating 
      cell elongation and cell size, and BR-related mutants in Arabidopsis display 
      significant dwarf phenotypes. Cellulose is a biopolymer which has a major 
      contribution to cell wall formation during cell expansion and elongation. 
      However, whether BRs regulate cellulose synthesis, and if so, what the underlying 
      mechanism of cell elongation induced by BRs is, is unknown. The content of 
      cellulose and the expression levels of the cellulose synthase genes (CESAs) was 
      measured in BR-related mutants and their wild-type counterpart. The chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (CHIP) experiments and genetic analysis were used to 
      demonstrate that BRs regulate CESA genes. It was found here that the BR-deficient 
      or BR-perceptional mutants contain less cellulose than the wild type. The 
      expression of CESA genes, especially those related to primary cell wall 
      synthesis, was reduced in det2-1 and bri1-301, and was only inducible by BRs in 
      the BR-deficient mutant det2-1. CHIP experiments show that the BR-activated 
      transcription factor BES1 can associate with upstream elements of most CESA genes 
      particularly those related with the primary cell wall. Furthermore, 
      over-expression of the BR receptor BRI1 in CESA1, 3, and 6 mutants can only 
      partially rescue the dwarf phenotypes. Our findings provide potential insights 
      into the mechanism that BRs regulate cellulose synthesis to accomplish the cell 
      elongation process in plant development.

AB  - The two closely related Arabidopsis transcription factors, WRKY18 and WRKY40, 
      play a major and partly redundant role in PAMP-triggered basal defense. We 
      monitored the transcriptional reprogramming induced by the powdery mildew fungus, 
      Golovinomyces orontii, during early stages of infection with respect to the role 
      of WRKY18/40. Expression of >1300 Arabidopsis genes was differentially altered 
      already 8 hours post infection (hpi), indicating rapid pre-penetration signaling 
      between the pathogen and the host. We found that WRKY18/40 negatively affects 
      pre-invasion host defenses and deduced a subset of genes that appear to be under 
      WRKY18/40 control. A mutant lacking the WRKY18/40 repressors executes 
      pathogen-dependent but exaggerated expression of some defense genes leading, for 
      example, to strongly elevated levels of camalexin. This implies that WRKY18/40 
      act in a feedback repression system controlling basal defense. Moreover, using 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), direct in vivo interactions of WRKY40 to 
      promoter regions containing W box elements of the regulatory gene EDS1, the 
      AP2-type transcription factor gene RRTF1 and to JAZ8, a member of the 
      JA-signaling repressor gene family were demonstrated. Our data support a model in 
      which WRKY18/40 negatively modulate the expression of positive regulators of 
      defense such as CYP71A13, EDS1 and PAD4, but positively modulate the expression 
      of some key JA-signaling genes by partly suppressing the expression of JAZ 
      repressors.

TI  - Brassinosteroids control male fertility by regulating the expression of key genes 
      involved in Arabidopsis anther and pollen development.
PG  - 6100-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0912333107 [doi]
AB  - The development of anther and pollen is important for male reproduction, and this 
      process is coordinately regulated by many external and internal cues. In this 
      study, we systematically examined the male reproductive phenotypes of a series of 
      brassinosteroid biosynthetic and signaling mutants and found that, besides the 
      expected cell-expansion defects, these mutants also showed reduced pollen number, 
      viability, and release efficiency. These defects were related with abnormal 
      tapetum and microspore development. Using both real-time quantitative RT-PCR and 
      microarray experiments, we found that the expression of many key genes required 
      for anther and pollen development was suppressed in these mutants. ChIP analysis 
      demonstrated that BES1, an important transcription factor for brassinosteroid 
      signaling, could directly bind to the promoter regions of genes encoding 
      transcription factors essential for anther and pollen development, SPL/NZZ, TDF1, 
      AMS, MS1, and MS2. Taken together, these data lead us to propose that 
      brassinosteroids control male fertility at least in part via directly regulating 
      key genes for anther and pollen development in Arabidopsis. Our work provides a 
      unique mechanism to explain how a phytohormone regulates an essential genetic 
      program for plant development.

AB  - Position-dependent cell fate determination and pattern formation are unique 
      aspects of the development of plant structures. The establishment of 
      single-celled leaf hairs (trichomes) from pluripotent epidermal (protodermal) 
      cells in Arabidopsis provides a powerful system to determine the gene regulatory 
      networks involved in cell fate determination. To obtain a holistic view of the 
      regulatory events associated with the differentiation of Arabidopsis epidermal 
      cells into trichomes, we combined expression and genome-wide location analyses 
      (ChIP-chip) on the trichome developmental selectors GLABRA3 (GL3) and GLABRA1 
      (GL1), encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and MYB transcription factors, 
      respectively. Meta-analysis was used to integrate genome-wide expression results 
      contrasting wild type and gl3 or gl1 mutants with changes in gene expression over 
      time using inducible versions of GL3 and GL1. This resulted in the identification 
      of a minimal set of genes associated with the differentiation of epidermal cells 
      into trichomes. ChIP-chip experiments, complemented by the targeted examination 
      of factors known to participate in trichome initiation or patterning, identified 
      about 20 novel GL3/GL1 direct targets. In addition to genes involved in the 
      control of gene expression, such as the transcription factors SCL8 and MYC1, we 
      identified SIM (SIAMESE), encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and RBR1 
      (RETINOBLASTOMA RELATED1), corresponding to a negative regulator of the cell 
      cycle transcription factor E2F, as GL3/GL1 immediate targets, directly 
      implicating these trichome regulators in the control of the endocycle. The 
      expression of many of the identified GL3/GL1 direct targets was specific to very 
      early stages of trichome initiation, suggesting that they participate in some of 
      the earliest known processes associated with protodermal cell differentiation. By 
      combining this knowledge with the analysis of genes associated with trichome 
      formation, our results reveal the architecture of the top tiers of the 
      hierarchical structure of the regulatory network involved in epidermal cell 
      differentiation and trichome formation.

TI  - A binary search approach to whole-genome data analysis.
PG  - 16893-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1011134107 [doi]
AB  - A sequence analysis-oriented binary search-like algorithm was transformed to a 
      sensitive and accurate analysis tool for processing whole-genome data. The 
      advantage of the algorithm over previous methods is its ability to detect the 
      margins of both short and long genome fragments, enriched by up-regulated 
      signals, at equal accuracy. The score of an enriched genome fragment reflects the 
      difference between the actual concentration of up-regulated signals in the 
      fragment and the chromosome signal baseline. The "divide-and-conquer"-type 
      algorithm detects a series of nonintersecting fragments of various lengths with 
      locally optimal scores. The procedure is applied to detected fragments in a 
      nested manner by recalculating the lower-than-baseline signals in the chromosome. 
      The algorithm was applied to simulated whole-genome data, and its 
      sensitivity/specificity were compared with those of several alternative 
      algorithms. The algorithm was also tested with four biological tiling array 
      datasets comprising Arabidopsis (i) expression and (ii) histone 3 lysine 27 
      trimethylation CHIP-on-chip datasets; Saccharomyces cerevisiae (iii) spliced 
      intron data and (iv) chromatin remodeling factor binding sites. The analyses' 
      results demonstrate the power of the algorithm in identifying both the short 
      up-regulated fragments (such as exons and transcription factor binding sites) and 
      the long--even moderately up-regulated zones--at their precise genome margins. 
      The algorithm generates an accurate whole-genome landscape that could be used for 
      cross-comparison of signals across the same genome in evolutionary and general 
      genomic studies.

AB  - The completion of the alfalfa, Arabidopsis, papaya, poplar, and rice genome 
      sequences along with ongoing sequencing projects of various crop species, offers 
      an excellent opportunity to study gene expression at the whole genome level and 
      to unravel the complexity of gene networks underlying the reprogramming of plant 
      defense toward pathogen challenge. Gene expression in eukaryotic cells is mainly 
      controlled by regulatory elements that recruit transcription factors (TFs) to 
      modulate transcriptional outputs. Therefore, methods allowing the identification 
      of all cognate TF binding sites (TFBS) within the regulatory regions of target 
      genes on a genome-wide basis are the next obvious step to elucidate the plant 
      defense transcriptome. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is one such powerful 
      technique for analyzing functional cis-regulatory DNA elements. The ChIP assay 
      allows the identification of specific regulatory DNA regions associated with 
      trans-acting regulatory factors in vivo. ChIP assays can provide spatial and 
      temporal snapshots of the regulatory components involved in reprogramming host 
      gene expression upon pathogen ingress. Moreover, the use of ChIP-enriched DNA for 
      hybridization to tiling microarrays (ChIP-chip) or for direct sequencing 
      (ChIP-Seq) by means of massively parallel sequencing technology has expanded this 
      methodology to address global changes in gene expression.

TI  - DamID-seq: A Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Method that Captures Both Transient and 
      Stable TF-DNA Interactions in Plant Cells.

AB  - Capturing the dynamic and transient interactions of a transcription factor (TF) 
      with its genome-wide targets whose regulation leads to plants' adaptation to 
      their changing environment is a major technical challenge. This is a widespread 
      problem with biochemical methods such as chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing 
      (ChIP-seq) which are biased towards capturing stable TF-target gene interactions. 
      Herein, we describe how DNA adenine methyltransferase identification and 
      sequencing (DamID-seq) can be used to capture both transient and stable TF-target 
      interactions by DNA methylation. The DamID technique uses a TF protein fused to a 
      DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) from E. coli. When expressed in a plant cell, 
      the Dam-TF fusion protein will methylate adenine (A) bases near the sites of 
      TF-DNA interactions. In this way, DamID results in a permanent, stable DNA 
      methylation mark on TF-target gene promoters, even if the target gene is only 
      transiently "touched" by the Dam-TF fusion protein. Here we provide a 
      step-by-step protocol to perform DamID-seq experiments in isolated plant cells 
      for any Dam-TF fusion protein of interest. We also provide information that will 
      enable researchers to analyze DamID-seq data to identify TF-binding sites in the 
      genome. Our protocol includes instructions for vector cloning of the Dam-TF 
      fusion proteins, plant cell protoplast transfections, DamID preps, library 
      preparation, and sequencing data analysis. The protocol outlined in this chapter 
      is performed in Arabidopsis thaliana, however, the DamID-seq workflow developed 
      in this guide is broadly applicable to other plants and organisms.

TI  - Identification of pathways directly regulated by SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE during 
      vegetative and reproductive development in Arabidopsis.
PG  - R56
LID - 10.1186/gb-2013-14-6-r56 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MADS-domain transcription factors play important roles during plant 
      development. The Arabidopsis MADS-box gene SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is a key 
      regulator of two developmental phases. It functions as a repressor of the floral 
      transition during the vegetative phase and later it contributes to the 
      specification of floral meristems. How these distinct activities are conferred by 
      a single transcription factor is unclear, but interactions with other MADS domain 
      proteins which specify binding to different genomic regions is likely one 
      mechanism. RESULTS: To compare the genome-wide DNA binding profile of SVP during 
      vegetative and reproductive development we performed ChIP-seq analyses. These 
      ChIP-seq data were combined with tiling array expression analysis, induction 
      experiments and qRT-PCR to identify biologically relevant binding sites. In 
      addition, we compared genome-wide target genes of SVP with those published for 
      the MADS domain transcription factors FLC and AP1, which interact with SVP during 
      the vegetative and reproductive phases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses 
      resulted in the identification of pathways that are regulated by SVP including 
      those controlling meristem development during vegetative growth and flower 
      development whereas floral transition pathways and hormonal signaling were 
      regulated predominantly during the vegetative phase. Thus, SVP regulates many 
      developmental pathways, some of which are common to both of its developmental 
      roles whereas others are specific to only one of them.

AB  - The balance between cellular proliferation and differentiation is a key aspect of 
      development in multicellular organisms. Using high-resolution expression data 
      from the Arabidopsis root, we identified a transcription factor, UPBEAT1 (UPB1), 
      that regulates this balance. Genomewide expression profiling coupled with 
      ChIP-chip analysis revealed that UPB1 directly regulates the expression of a set 
      of peroxidases that modulate the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) between 
      the zones of cell proliferation and the zone of cell elongation where 
      differentiation begins. Disruption of UPB1 activity alters this ROS balance, 
      leading to a delay in the onset of differentiation. Modulation of either ROS 
      balance or peroxidase activity through chemical reagents affects the onset of 
      differentiation in a manner consistent with the postulated UPB1 function. This 
      pathway functions independently of auxin and cytokinin plant hormonal signaling. 
      Comparison to ROS-regulated growth control in animals suggests that a similar 
      mechanism is used in plants and animals.

TI  - AtHAP5A modulates freezing stress resistance in Arabidopsis through binding to 
      CCAAT motif of AtXTH21.
PG  - 554-567
LID - 10.1111/nph.12812 [doi]
AB  - Several eukaryotic Heme-associated proteins (HAPs) have been reported to bind 
      specifically to DNA fragments containing CCAAT-box; however, the physiological 
      functions and direct targets of these HAP proteins in plants remain unclear. In 
      this study, we showed that AtHAP5A as a transcription factor interacted with 
      CCAAT motif in vivo, and AtXTH21, one direct target of AtHAP5A, was involved in 
      freezing stress resistance. The AtHAP5A overexpressing plants were more tolerant, 
      whereas the loss-of-function mutant of AtHAP5A was more sensitive to freezing 
      stress than wild-type plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay 
      demonstrated that AtHAP5A could bind to five fragments that contained CCAAT 
      motifs in the AtXTH21 promoter. Similarly, the AtXTH21 overexpressing plants 
      exhibited improved freezing resistance, while xth21 knockdown mutants displayed 
      decreased freezing resistance. Notably, the modulated freezing resistance of 
      AtHAP5A overexpressing plants and knockout mutant could be reversed by the xth21 
      mutant and AtXTH21 overexpressing plants, respectively, indicating that AtHAP5A 
      might act upstream of AtXTH21 in freezing stress. Additionally, modulation of 
      AtHAP5A and AtXTH21 expression had the same effects on abscisic acid (ABA) 
      sensitivity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Taken together, these 
      results demonstrated that AtHAP5A modulates freezing stress resistance in 
      Arabidopsis through binding to the CCAAT motif of AtXTH21.

TI  - Negative feedback regulation of ABA biosynthesis in peanut (Arachis hypogaea): a 
      transcription factor complex inhibits AhNCED1 expression during water stress.
PG  - 37943
LID - 10.1038/srep37943 [doi]
LID - 37943
AB  - Abscisic acid (ABA), a key plant stress-signaling hormone, is produced in 
      response to drought and counteracts the effects of this stress. The accumulation 
      of ABA is controlled by the enzyme 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED). In 
      Arabidopsis, NCED3 is regulated by a positive feedback mechanism by ABA. In this 
      study in peanut (Arachis hypogaea), we demonstrate that ABA biosynthesis is also 
      controlled by negative feedback regulation, mediated by the inhibitory effect on 
      AhNCED1 transcription of a protein complex between transcription factors AhNAC2 
      and AhAREB1. AhNCED1 was significantly down-regulated after PEG treatment for 
      10 h, at which time ABA content reached a peak. A ChIP-qPCR assay confirmed 
      AhAREB1 and AhNAC2 binding to the AhNCED1 promoter in response to ABA. Moreover, 
      the interaction between AhAREB1 and AhNAC2, and a transient expression assay 
      showed that the protein complex could negatively regulate the expression of 
      AhNCED1. The results also demonstrated that AhAREB1 was the key factor in AhNCED1 
      feedback regulation, while AhNAC2 played a subsidiary role. ABA reduced the rate 
      of AhAREB1 degradation and enhanced both the synthesis and degradation rate of 
      the AhNAC2 protein. In summary, the AhAREB1/AhNAC2 protein complex functions as a 
      negative feedback regulator of drought-induced ABA biosynthesis in peanut.

TI  - The G-Protein β Subunit AGB1 Promotes Hypocotyl Elongation through Inhibiting 
      Transcription Activation Function of BBX21 in Arabidopsis.

AB  - Hypocotyl development in Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by light and 
      endogenous hormonal cues, making it an ideal model to study the interplay between 
      light and endogenous growth regulators. BBX21, a B-box (BBX)-like zinc-finger 
      transcription factor, integrates light and abscisic acid signals to regulate 
      hypocotyl elongation in Arabidopsis. Heterotrimeric G-proteins are pivotal 
      regulators of plant development. The short hypocotyl phenotype of the G-protein 
      β-subunit (AGB1) mutant (agb1-2) has been previously identified, but the precise 
      role of AGB1 in hypocotyl elongation remains enigmatic. Here, we show that AGB1 
      directly interacts with BBX21, and the short hypocotyl phenotype of agb1-2 is 
      partially suppressed in agb1-2bbx21-1 double mutant. BBX21 functions in the 
      downstream of AGB1 and overexpression of BBX21 in agb1-2 causes a more pronounced 
      reduction in hypocotyl length, indicating that AGB1 plays an oppositional role in 
      relation to BBX21 during hypocotyl development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 
      the C-terminal region of BBX21 is important for both its intracellular 
      localization and its transcriptional activation activity that is inhibited by 
      interaction with AGB1. ChIP assays showed that BBX21 specifically associates with 
      its own promoter and with those of BBX22, HY5, and GA2ox1. which is not altered 
      in agb1-2. These data suggest that the AGB1-BBX21 interaction only affects the 
      transcriptional activation activity of BBX21 but has no effect on its DNA binding 
      ability. Taken together, our data demonstrate that AGB1 positively promotes 
      hypocotyl elongation through repressing BBX21 activity.

TI  - BES1 regulates the localization of the brassinosteroid receptor BRL3 within the 
      provascular tissue of the Arabidopsis primary root.
PG  - 4951-61
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erw258 [doi]
AB  - Brassinosteroid (BR) hormones are important regulators of plant growth and 
      development. Recent studies revealed the cell-specific role of BRs in vascular 
      and stem cell development by the action of cell-specific BR receptor complexes 
      and downstream signaling components in Arabidopsis thaliana Despite the 
      importance of spatiotemporal regulation of hormone signaling in the control of 
      plant vascular development, the mechanisms that confer cellular specificity to BR 
      receptors within the vascular cells are not yet understood. The present work 
      shows that BRI1-like receptor genes 1 and 3 (BRL1 and BRL3) are differently 
      regulated by BRs. By using promoter deletion constructs of BRL1 and BRL3 fused to 
      GFP/GUS (green fluorescent protein/β-glucuronidase) reporters in Arabidopsis, 
      analysis of their cell-specific expression and regulation by BRs in the root apex 
      has been carried out. We found that BRL3 expression is finely modulated by BRs in 
      different root cell types, whereas the location of BRL1 appears to be independent 
      of this hormone. Physiological and genetic analysis show a BR-dependent 
      expression of BRL3 in the root meristem. In particular, BRL3 expression requires 
      active BES1, a central transcriptional effector within the BRI1 pathway. ChIP 
      analysis showed that BES1 directly binds to the BRRE present in the BRL3 promoter 
      region, modulating its transcription in different subsets of cells of the root 
      apex. Overall our study reveals the existence of a cell-specific negative 
      feedback loop from BRI1-mediated BES1 transcription factor to BRL3 in phloem 
      cells, while contributing to a general understanding of the spatial control of 
      steroid signaling in plant development.

TI  - Direct interaction of AGL24 and SOC1 integrates flowering signals in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1481-91
LID - 10.1242/dev.020255 [doi]
AB  - During the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, the shoot meristem 
      of flowering plants acquires the inflorescence identity to generate flowers 
      rather than vegetative tissues. An important regulator that promotes the 
      inflorescence identity in Arabidopsis is AGAMOUS-LIKE 24 (AGL24), a MADS-box 
      transcription factor. Using a functional estradiol-inducible system in 
      combination with microarray analysis, we identified AGL24-induced genes, 
      including SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1), a floral pathway 
      integrator. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of a functional 
      AGL24-6HA-tagged line revealed in vivo binding of AGL24-6HA to the regulatory 
      region of SOC1. Mutagenesis of the AGL24 binding site in the SOC1 promoter 
      decreased Pro(SOC1):GUS expression and compromised SOC1 function in promoting 
      flowering. Our results show that SOC1 is one of the direct targets of AGL24, and 
      that SOC1 expression is upregulated by AGL24 at the shoot apex at the floral 
      transitional stage. ChIP assay using a functional SOC1-9myc-tagged line and 
      promoter mutagenesis analysis also revealed in vivo binding of SOC1-9myc to the 
      regulatory regions of AGL24 and upregulation of AGL24 at the shoot apex by SOC1. 
      Furthermore, we found that as in other flowering genetic pathways, the effect of 
      gibberellins on flowering under short-day conditions was mediated by the 
      interaction between AGL24 and SOC1. These observations suggest that during floral 
      transition, a positive-feedback loop conferred by direct transcriptional 
      regulation between AGL24 and SOC1 at the shoot apex integrates flowering signals.

TI  - DNA-binding study identifies C-box and hybrid C/G-box or C/A-box motifs as 
      high-affinity binding sites for STF1 and LONG HYPOCOTYL5 proteins.
PG  - 1862-77
LID - 10.1104/pp.107.113217 [doi]
AB  - LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) is a bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcription factor that 
      activates photomorphogenesis and root development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
      thaliana). Previously, STF1 (soybean [Glycine max] TGACG-motif binding factor 1), 
      a homologous legume protein with a RING-finger motif and a bZIP domain, was 
      reported in soybean. To investigate the role of STF1, the phenotypes of 
      transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing STF1 and HY5 were compared. In 
      addition, the DNA-binding properties of STF1 and HY5 were extensively studied 
      using random binding site selection and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 
      Overexpression of STF1 in the hy5 mutant of Arabidopsis restored wild-type 
      photomorphogenic and root development phenotypes of short hypocotyl, accumulation 
      of chlorophyll, and root gravitropism with partial restoration of anthocyanin 
      accumulation. This supports that STF1 is a homolog of HY5 with a role in light 
      and hormone signaling. The DNA-binding properties of STF1 and HY5 are shown to be 
      similar to each other in recognizing many ACGT-containing elements with a 
      consensus sequence motif of 5'-(G/A)(G/A) TGACGT(C/G/A)(A/T/G)-3'. The motif 
      represents a characteristically strong preference for flanking sequence to TGACGT 
      and a larger sequence than the sequences recognized by the G-box binding factor 
      and TGA protein families. The finding of C-box, hybrid C/G-, and C/A-boxes as 
      high-affinity binding sites over the G-box and parameters associated with HY5 
      recognition define the criteria of HY5/STF1 protein-DNA interaction in the 
      promoter regions. This study helps to predict the precise in vivo binding sites 
      of the HY5 protein from the vast number of putative HY5 genomic binding sites 
      analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation on chip.

      thaliana genome function. However, there is a relative paucity of computational 
      systems for efficiently and effectively using these data to create testable 
      hypotheses. We present CressInt, a user-friendly web resource for exploring gene 
      regulatory mechanisms in A. thaliana on a genomic scale. The CressInt system 
      incorporates a variety of genome-wide data types relevant to gene regulation, 
      including transcription factor (TF) binding site models, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, 
      eQTLs, and GWAS. We demonstrate the utility of CressInt by showing how the system 
      can be used to (1) Identify TFs binding to the promoter of a gene of interest; 
      (2) identify genetic variants that are likely to impact TF binding based on a 
      ChIP-seq dataset; and (3) identify specific TFs whose binding might be impacted 
      by phenotype-associated variants. CressInt is freely available at 
      http://cressint.cchmc.org.

TI  - Analysis of transcription factor HY5 genomic binding sites revealed its 
      hierarchical role in light regulation of development.
PG  - 731-49
AB  - The transcription factor LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) acts downstream of multiple 
      families of the photoreceptors and promotes photomorphogenesis. Although it is 
      well accepted that HY5 acts to regulate target gene expression, in vivo binding 
      of HY5 to any of its target gene promoters has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we 
      used a chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure to verify suspected in vivo HY5 
      binding sites. We demonstrated that in vivo association of HY5 with promoter 
      targets is not altered under distinct light qualities or during light-to-dark 
      transition. Coupled with DNA chip hybridization using a high-density 
      60-nucleotide oligomer microarray that contains one probe for every 500 
      nucleotides over the entire Arabidopsis thaliana genome, we mapped genome-wide in 
      vivo HY5 binding sites. This analysis showed that HY5 binds preferentially to 
      promoter regions in vivo and revealed >3000 chromosomal sites as putative HY5 
      binding targets. HY5 binding targets tend to be enriched in the early 
      light-responsive genes and transcription factor genes. Our data thus support a 
      model in which HY5 is a high hierarchical regulator of the transcriptional 
      cascades for photomorphogenesis.

TI  - Characterization of SOC1's central role in flowering by the identification of its 
      upstream and downstream regulators.
PG  - 433-49
LID - 10.1104/pp.112.202614 [doi]
AB  - The transition from vegetative to reproductive development is one of the most 
      important phase changes in the plant life cycle. This step is controlled by 
      various environmental signals that are integrated at the molecular level by 
      so-called floral integrators. One such floral integrator in Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) is the MADS domain transcription factor SUPPRESSOR OF 
      OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1). Despite extensive genetic studies, little is 
      known about the transcriptional control of SOC1, and we are just starting to 
      explore the network of genes under the direct control of SOC1 transcription 
      factor complexes. Here, we show that several MADS domain proteins, including SOC1 
      heterodimers, are able to bind SOC1 regulatory sequences. Genome-wide target gene 
      analysis by ChIP-seq confirmed the binding of SOC1 to its own locus and shows 
      that it also binds to a plethora of flowering-time regulatory and floral homeotic 
      genes. In turn, the encoded floral homeotic MADS domain proteins appear to bind 
      SOC1 regulatory sequences. Subsequent in planta analyses revealed SOC1 repression 
      by several floral homeotic MADS domain proteins, and we show that, 
      mechanistically, this depends on the presence of the SOC1 protein. Together, our 
      data show that SOC1 constitutes a major hub in the regulatory networks underlying 
      floral timing and flower development and that these networks are composed of many 
      positive and negative autoregulatory and feedback loops. The latter seems to be 
      crucial for the generation of a robust flower-inducing signal, followed shortly 
      after by repression of the SOC1 floral integrator.

TI  - DYT1 directly regulates the expression of TDF1 for tapetum development and pollen 
      wall formation in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 1005-13
LID - 10.1111/tpj.12694 [doi]
AB  - The tapetum plays a critical role during the development and maturation of 
      microspores. DYSFUNCTIONAL TAPETUM 1 (DYT1) is essential for early tapetal 
      development. Here, we determined that the promoter region (-550 to -463 bp) 
      contains indispensable cis-elements for DYT1 expression. Although DYT1 
      transcripts can be detected in both meiocytes and tapetal cells, localization of 
      DYT1-GFP demonstrated that DYT1 is strictly located in tapetal cells during 
      microsporogenesis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that 
      DYT1 directly binds the promoter region of Defective in Tapetal Development and 
      Function 1 (TDF1), a transcription factor essential for tapetum development. When 
      TDF1 driven by the DYT1 promoter is expressed in a dyt1 mutant, the expression of 
      the transcription factors AMS, MS188/MYB80, TEK and MS1 and the pollen 
      wall-related genes are restored. Although the pollen wall is not formed and the 
      microspores are ruptured, DIOC2 staining showed that fatty acids, the precursors 
      of the pollen wall, were synthesized in the transgenic lines. These results 
      indicate that DYT1 regulates the expression of AMS, MS188/MYB80, TEK and MS1 for 
      pollen wall formation, primarily via TDF1.

TI  - Phytochrome-interacting factor 4 (PIF4) inhibits expression of SHORT HYPOCOTYL 2 
      (SHY2) to promote hypocotyl growth during shade avoidance in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 857-863

AB  - Plants sense the presence of competing neighboring vegetation as a change in 
      light quality. These changes initiate shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) responses. 
      PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) are crucial factors in the SAS response. 
      In particular, they mediate the expression of multiple phytohormones and cell 
      expansion genes. Many positive regulatory factors in the SAS response have been 
      identified, but the negative regulation of SAS transcription factors remains 
      poorly understood. The functions of the short hypocotyl 2 (SHY2) transcription 
      factor during the SAS response have not been established, although its roles in 
      the participating hormone and stress responses are well documented. Here, the 
      SHY2 loss-of-function (shy2-31) mutant had a longer hypocotyl, but the 
      gain-of-function (shy2-2) hypocotyl was shorter than that of the wild type under 
      white and shade conditions. We showed that the SHY2 expression level and its 
      associated protein significantly accumulated under shade conditions. Furthermore, 
      SHY2 transcript levels significantly increased in mutant pifQ, but decreased in 
      PIF4OX compared to the wild type, which indicated that PIF4 is a transcriptional 
      repressor of SHY2. ChIP assays have consistently shown that PIF4 directly binds 
      to the promoters of SHY2. We further show that PIF4OX partially rescued the short 
      hypocotyl characteristic of shy2-2 under white and shade conditions. Our results 
      provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms controlling SAS mediated 
      elongation of the hypocotyl by PIF4-SHY2 modules in Arabidopsis.

TI  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 mediates nuclear translocation of ORE3 to 
      promote ORE9 gene expression in methyl jasmonate-induced leaf senescence.
PG  - 83-94
LID - 10.1093/jxb/erv438 [doi]
AB  - Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a potent promoter of plant senescence. ORESARA3 
      (ORE3)/ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2), a protein similar to the members of the 
      disease-related Nramp metal transporter family, is involved in cross-talk among 
      several senescence processes related to abscisic acid, ethylene, MeJA, age and 
      darkness. Nevertheless, the mechanism involved in the regulation of ORE3/EIN2 in 
      exogenous MeJA-induced leaf senescence remains unclear. The C-terminal end of 
      ORE3/EIN2 (CEND) was cleaved from ORE3/EIN2 located in the endoplasmic reticulum 
      and then transferred to the nucleus during MeJA-induced senescence. Further 
      analyses showed that mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MPK6) promoted CEND 
      cleavage and nuclear translocation. Nuclear CEND accumulated ETHYLENE 
      INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), a transcription factor that accelerates MeJA-induced leaf 
      senescence wherein ORESARA9 (ORE9) expression was suppressed in ein3, ore3, and 
      mpk6 mutant plants. ChIP experiments revealed that EIN3 bound directly to the 
      ORE9 promoter and this binding was enhanced in MeJA-induced leaf senescence. This 
      study revealed the effect of the signalling pathway involving MPK6-ORE3-EIN3-ORE9 
      on regulating leaf senescence and provided insights into the mechanism of MeJA in 
      promoting leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana.

AB  - Ambient concentrations of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) inhibit the 
      binding of PIF4 to promoter regions of auxin pathway genes to suppress hypocotyl 
      elongation in Arabidopsis. Ambient concentrations (10-50 ppb) of atmospheric 
      nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) positively regulate plant growth to the extent that 
      organ size and shoot biomass can nearly double in various species, including 
      Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). However, the precise molecular mechanism 
      underlying NO(2)-mediated processes in plants, and the involvement of specific 
      molecules in these processes, remain unknown. We measured hypocotyl elongation 
      and the transcript levels of PIF4, encoding a bHLH transcription factor, and its 
      target genes in wild-type (WT) and various pif mutants grown in the presence or 
      absence of 50 ppb NO(2). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to 
      quantify binding of PIF4 to the promoter regions of its target genes. NO(2) 
      suppressed hypocotyl elongation in WT plants, but not in the pifq or pif4 
      mutants. NO(2) suppressed the expression of target genes of PIF4, but did not 
      affect the transcript level of the PIF4 gene itself or the level of PIF4 protein. 
      NO(2) inhibited the binding of PIF4 to the promoter regions of two of its target 
      genes, SAUR46 and SAUR67. In conclusion, NO(2) inhibits the binding of PIF4 to 
      the promoter regions of genes involved in the auxin pathway to suppress hypocotyl 
      elongation in Arabidopsis. Consequently, PIF4 emerges as a pivotal participant in 
      this regulatory process. This study has further clarified the intricate 
      regulatory mechanisms governing plant responses to environmental pollutants, 
      thereby advancing our understanding of how plants adapt to changing atmospheric 
      conditions.

TI  - ABI5 acts downstream of ABI3 to execute an ABA-dependent growth arrest during 
      germination.
PG  - 317-28
AB  - The development of a germinating embryo into an autotrophic seedling is arrested 
      under conditions of water deficit. This ABA-mediated developmental checkpoint 
      requires the bZIP transcription factor ABI5. Here, we used abi3-1, which is also 
      unable to execute this checkpoint, to investigate the relative role of ABI3 and 
      ABI5 in this process. In wild-type Arabidopsis plants, ABI3 expression and 
      activity parallel those described for ABI5 following stratification. During this 
      process, transcript levels of late embryogenesis genes such as AtEm1 and AtEm6 
      are also re-induced, which might be responsible for the acquired osmotic 
      tolerance in germinated embryos whose growth is arrested. ABI5 expression is 
      greatly reduced in abi3-1 mutants, which has low AtEm1 or AtEm6 expression. Cross 
      complementation experiments showed that 35S-ABI5 could complement abi3-1, whereas 
      35S-ABI3 cannot complement abi5-4. These results indicate that ABI5 acts 
      downstream of ABI3 to reactivate late embryogenesis programmes and to arrest 
      growth of germinating embryos. Although ABI5 is consistently located in the 
      nucleus, chromosomal immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that ABA 
      increases ABI5 occupancy on the AtEm6 promoter.

AB  - DamID (DNA adenine methylation identification) is an adenine methylation-based 
      tagging method designed to map protein-DNA interactions in vivo. DamID, an 
      alternative method to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), is based on the 
      covalent linking of a "fingerprint" in the vicinity of the DNA-binding sites of 
      the protein of interest. The fingerprints can be further mapped by simple 
      molecular approaches. First developed by van Steensel's group in Drosophila 
      melanogaster, DamID was successfully adapted to Arabidopsis thaliana, and its 
      feasibility demonstrated by using the well-known yeast GAL4 transcription factor. 
      The method was further used to establish a genome-wide map of the target sites of 
      LHP1, a regulatory chromatin protein in A. thaliana.

AB  - The Arabidopsis mutant wrky33 is highly susceptible to Botrytis cinerea. We 
      identified &gt;1680 Botrytis-induced WRKY33 binding sites associated with 1576 
      Arabidopsis genes. Transcriptional profiling defined 318 functional direct target 
      genes at 14 hr post inoculation. Comparative analyses revealed that WRKY33 
      possesses dual functionality acting either as a repressor or as an activator in a 
      promoter-context dependent manner. We confirmed known WRKY33 targets involved in 
      hormone signaling and phytoalexin biosynthesis, but also uncovered a novel 
      negative role of abscisic acid (ABA) in resistance towards B. cinerea 2100. The 
      ABA biosynthesis genes NCED3 and NCED5 were identified as direct targets required 
      for WRKY33-mediated resistance. Loss-of-WRKY33 function resulted in elevated ABA 
      levels and genetic studies confirmed that WRKY33 acts upstream of NCED3/NCED5 to 
      negatively regulate ABA biosynthesis. This study provides the first detailed view 
      of the genome-wide contribution of a specific plant transcription factor in 
      modulating the transcriptional network associated with plant immunity.

AB  - Studies have shown that some plant-specific NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, CUC2) 
      transcription factors may increase plants resistance to stress. We screened the 
      genes differentially expressed in transgenic SlNAC1 Arabidopsis compared to the 
      wild type by cDNA microarry, to provide scientific basis for studying the genes 
      related to abiotic stress responses in transgenic Arabidopsis. There were 3 046 
      genes differentially expressed more than twice in the total 43 604 genes of 
      transgenic SlNAC1 Arabidopsis. Gene ontology analysis was used on genes 
      differentially expressed more than five-fold. Genes relevant to cellular 
      components occupied 33.05%, genes correlated with molecular function accounted 
      for 33.95% and genes pertinent to biological process constituted a 33.00%

TI  - An effective approach for identification of in vivo protein-DNA binding sites 
      from paired-end ChIP-Seq data.
PG  - 81

AB  - BACKGROUND: ChIP-Seq, which combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with 
      high-throughput massively parallel sequencing, is increasingly being used for 
      identification of protein-DNA interactions in vivo in the genome. However, to 
      maximize the effectiveness of data analysis of such sequences requires the 
      development of new algorithms that are able to accurately predict DNA-protein 
      binding sites. RESULTS: Here, we present SIPeS (Site Identification from 
      Paired-end Sequencing), a novel algorithm for precise identification of binding 
      sites from short reads generated by paired-end solexa ChIP-Seq technology. In 
      this paper we used ChIP-Seq data from the Arabidopsis basic helix-loop-helix 
      transcription factor ABORTED MICROSPORES (AMS), which is expressed within the 
      anther during pollen development, the results show that SIPeS has better 
      resolution for binding site identification compared to two existing ChIP-Seq peak 
      detection algorithms, Cisgenome and MACS. CONCLUSIONS: When compared to Cisgenome 
      and MACS, SIPeS shows better resolution for binding site discovery. Moreover, 
      SIPeS is designed to calculate the mappable genome length accurately with the 
      fragment length based on the paired-end reads. Dynamic baselines are also 
      employed to effectively discriminate closely adjacent binding sites, for 
      effective binding sites discovery, which is of particular value when working with 
      high-density genomes.

TI  - The bromodomain protein GTE6 controls leaf development in Arabidopsis by histone 
      acetylation at ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1.
PG  - 2245-54
AB  - The transition from the juvenile to the mature phase during vegetative 
      development in plants is characterized by changes in leaf shape. We show that 
      GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E6 (GTE6) regulates differences in leaf 
      patterning between juvenile and mature leaves in Arabidopsis. GTE6 encodes a 
      novel small bromodomain-containing protein unique to plants. Mutations in GTE6 
      disrupt the formation of elliptical leaf laminae in mature leaves, whereas 
      overexpression of GTE6 resulted in elongated juvenile leaves. GTE6 positively 
      regulates the expression of ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1), which encodes a myb-domain 
      protein that controls proximodistal patterning of leaves. Using chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we show that GTE6 is associated with the 
      promoter and the start of the transcribed region of AS1 and up-regulates 
      expression of AS1 through acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Genetic studies 
      demonstrated that AS1 is epistatic to GTE6, indicating that GTE6 regulates AS1 
      during leaf morphogenesis. Chromatin remodeling at AS1 is a key regulatory 
      mechanism in leaf development, which ensures the continual production of mature 
      leaves following juvenile-adult transition, thereby maintaining the identity of 
      the mature vegetative phase.

TI  - Molecular aspects of zygotic embryogenesis in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.): 
      correlation of positive histone marks with HaWUS expression and putative link 
      HaWUS/HaL1L.
PG  - 199-215
LID - 10.1007/s00425-015-2405-2 [doi]
AB  - The link HaWUS/ HaL1L , the opposite transcriptional behavior, and the 
      decrease/increase in positive histone marks bond to both genes suggest an 
      inhibitory effect of WUS on HaL1L in sunflower zygotic embryos. In Arabidopsis, a 
      group of transcription factors implicated in the earliest events of embryogenesis 
      is the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) protein family including WUSCHEL (WUS) and 
      other 14 WOX protein, some of which contain a conserved WUS-box domain in 
      addition to the homeodomain. WUS transcripts appear very early in embryogenesis, 
      at the 16-cell embryo stage, but gradually become restricted to the center of the 
      developing shoot apical meristem (SAM) primordium and continues to be expressed 
      in cells of the niche/organizing center of SAM and floral meristems to maintain 
      stem cell population. Moreover, WUS has decisive roles in the embryonic program 
      presumably promoting the vegetative-to-embryonic transition and/or maintaining 
      the identity of the embryonic stem cells. However, data on the direct interaction 
      between WUS and key genes for seed development (as LEC1 and L1L) are not 
      collected. The novelty of this report consists in the characterization of 
      Helianthus annuus WUS (HaWUS) gene and in its analysis regarding the pattern of 
      the methylated lysine 4 (K4) of the Histone H3 and of the acetylated histone H3 
      during the zygotic embryo development. Also, a parallel investigation was 
      performed for HaL1L gene since two copies of the WUS-binding site (WUSATA), 
      previously identified on HaL1L nucleotide sequence, were able to be bound by the 
      HaWUS recombinant protein suggesting a not described effect of HaWUS on HaL1L 
      transcription.

AB  - The plant hormone ethylene regulates numerous developmental processes and stress 
      responses. Ethylene signaling proceeds via a linear pathway, which activates 
      transcription factor (TF) EIN3, a primary transcriptional regulator of ethylene 
      response. EIN3 influences gene expression upon binding to a specific sequence in 
      gene promoters. This interaction, however, might be considerably affected by 
      additional co-factors. In this work, we perform whole genome bioinformatics study 
      to identify the impact of epigenetic factors in EIN3 functioning. The analysis of 
      publicly available ChIP-Seq data on EIN3 binding in Arabidopsis thaliana showed 
      bimodality of distribution of EIN3 binding regions (EBRs) in gene promoters. 
      Besides a sharp peak in close proximity to transcription start site, which is a 
      common binding region for a wide variety of TFs, we found an additional extended 
      peak in the distal promoter region. We characterized all EBRs with respect to the 
      epigenetic status appealing to previously published genome-wide map of nine 
      chromatin states in A. thaliana. We found that the implicit distal peak was 
      associated with a specific chromatin state (referred to as chromatin state 4 in 
      the primary source), which was just poorly represented in the pronounced proximal 
      peak. Intriguingly, EBRs corresponding to this chromatin state 4 were 
      significantly associated with ethylene response, unlike the others representing 
      the overwhelming majority of EBRs related to the explicit proximal peak. 
      Moreover, we found that specific EIN3 binding sequences predicted with previously 
      described model were enriched in the EBRs mapped to the chromatin state 4, but 
      not to the rest ones. These results allow us to conclude that the interplay of 
      genetic and epigenetic factors might cause the distinct modes of EIN3 regulation.

AB  - Several transcription factors (TFs) coordinate to regulate expression of specific 
      genes at the transcriptional level. In Arabidopsis thaliana it is estimated that 
      approximately 10% of all genes encode TFs or TF-like proteins. It is important to 
      identify target genes that are directly regulated by TFs in order to understand 
      the complete picture of a plant's transcriptome profile. Here, we investigate the 
      role of the LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) transcription factor that acts as a regulator 
      of photomorphogenesis. We used an in vitro genomic DNA binding assay coupled with 
      immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing (gDB-seq) instead of the in 
      vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-based methods. The results demonstrate 
      that the HY5-binding motif predicted here was similar to the motif reported 
      previously and that in vitro HY5-binding loci largely overlapped with the 
      HY5-targeted candidate genes identified in previous ChIP-chip analysis. By 
      combining these results with microarray analysis, we identified hundreds of 
      HY5-binding genes that were differentially expressed in hy5. We also observed 
      delayed induction of some transcripts of HY5-binding genes in hy5 mutants in 
      response to blue-light exposure after dark treatment. Thus, an in vitro 
      gDNA-binding assay coupled with sequencing is a convenient and powerful method to 
      bridge the gap between identifying TF binding potential and establishing 
      function.

TI  - CAGER: classification analysis of gene expression regulation using multiple 
      information sources.
PG  - 114
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many classification approaches have been applied to analyzing 
      transcriptional regulation of gene expressions. These methods build models that 
      can explain a gene's expression level from the regulatory elements (features) on 
      its promoter sequence. Different types of features, such as experimentally 
      verified binding motifs, motifs discovered by computer programs, or transcription 
      factor binding data measured with Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, 
      have been used towards this goal. Each type of features has been shown successful 
      in modeling gene transcriptional regulation under certain conditions. However, no 
      comparison has been made to evaluate the relative merit of these features. 
      Furthermore, most publicly available classification tools were not designed 
      specifically for modeling transcriptional regulation, and do not allow the user 
      to combine different types of features. RESULTS: In this study, we use a specific 
      classification method, decision trees, to model transcriptional regulation in 
      yeast with features based on predefined motifs, automatically identified motifs, 
      ChlP-chip data, or their combinations. We compare the accuracies and stability of 
      these models, and analyze their capabilities in identifying functionally related 
      genes. Furthermore, we design and implement a user-friendly web server called 
      CAGER (Classification Analysis of Gene Expression Regulation) that integrates 
      several software components for automated analysis of transcriptional regulation 
      using decision trees. Finally, we use CAGER to study the transcriptional 
      regulation of Arabidopsis genes in response to abscisic acid, and report some 
      interesting new results. CONCLUSION: Models built with ChlP-chip data suffer from 
      low accuracies when the condition under which gene expressions are measured is 
      significantly different from the condition under which the ChIP experiment is 
      conducted. Models built with automatically identified motifs can sometimes 
      discover new features, but their modeling accuracies may have been over-estimated 
      in previous studies. Furthermore, models built with automatically identified 
      motifs are not stable with respect to noises. A combination of ChlP-chip data and 
      predefined motifs can substantially improve modeling accuracies, and is effective 
      in identifying true regulons. The CAGER web server, which is freely available at 
      http://cic.cs.wustl.edu/CAGER/, allows the user to select combinations of 
      different feature types for building decision trees, and interact with the models 
      graphically. We believe that it will be a useful tool to facilitate the discovery 
      of gene transcriptional regulatory networks.

TI  - Genome-wide gene expression analysis reveals a critical role for CRYPTOCHROME1 in 
      the response of Arabidopsis to high irradiance.
PG  - 1391-406
AB  - Exposure to high irradiance results in dramatic changes in nuclear gene 
      expression in plants. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which 
      changes in irradiance are sensed and how the information is transduced to the 
      nucleus to initiate the genetic response. To investigate whether the 
      photoreceptors are involved in the response to high irradiance, we analyzed 
      expression of EARLY LIGHT-INDUCIBLE PROTEIN1 (ELIP1), ELIP2, ASCORBATE 
      PEROXIDASE2 (APX2), and LIGHT-HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL A/B-BINDING PROTEIN2.4 
      (LHCB2.4) in the phytochrome A (phyA), phyB, cryptochrome1 (cry1), and cry2 
      photoreceptor mutants and long hypocotyl5 (hy5) and HY5 homolog (hyh) 
      transcription factor mutants. Following exposure to high intensity white light 
      for 3 h (1,000 mumol quanta m(-2) s(-1)) expression of ELIP1/2 and APX2 was 
      strongly induced and LHCB2.4 expression repressed in wild type. The cry1 and hy5 
      mutants showed specific misregulation of ELIP1/2, and we show that the induction 
      of ELIP1/2 expression is mediated via CRY1 in a blue light intensity-dependent 
      manner. Furthermore, using the Affymetrix Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) 24 K 
      Gene-Chip, we showed that 77 of the high light-responsive genes are regulated via 
      CRY1, and 26 of those genes were also HY5 dependent. As a consequence of the 
      misregulation of these genes, the cry1 mutant displayed a high 
      irradiance-sensitive phenotype with significant photoinactivation of photosystem 
      II, indicated by reduced maximal fluorescence ratio. Thus, we describe a novel 
      function of CRY1 in mediating plant responses to high irradiances that is 
      essential to the induction of photoprotective mechanisms. This indicates that 
      high irradiance can be sensed in a chloroplast-independent manner by a 
      cytosolic/nucleic component.

TI  - Polycomb group gene OsFIE2 regulates rice (Oryza sativa) seed development and 
      grain filling via a mechanism distinct from Arabidopsis.

AB  - Cereal endosperm represents 60% of the calories consumed by human beings 
      worldwide. In addition, cereals also serve as the primary feedstock for 
      livestock. However, the regulatory mechanism of cereal endosperm and seed 
      development is largely unknown. Polycomb complex has been shown to play a key 
      role in the regulation of endosperm development in Arabidopsis, but its role in 
      cereal endosperm development remains obscure. Additionally, the enzyme activities 
      of the polycomb complexes have not been demonstrated in plants. Here we purified 
      the rice OsFIE2-polycomb complex using tandem affinity purification and 
      demonstrated its specific H3 methyltransferase activity. We found that the OsFIE2 
      gene product was responsible for H3K27me3 production specifically in vivo. 
      Genetic studies showed that a reduction of OsFIE2 expression led to smaller 
      seeds, partially filled seeds, and partial loss of seed dormancy. Gene expression 
      and proteomics analyses found that the starch synthesis rate limiting step enzyme 
      and multiple storage proteins are down-regulated in OsFIE2 reduction lines. 
      Genome wide ChIP-Seq data analysis shows that H3K27me3 is associated with many 
      genes in the young seeds. The H3K27me3 modification and gene expression in a key 
      helix-loop-helix transcription factor is shown to be regulated by OsFIE2. Our 
      results suggest that OsFIE2-polycomb complex positively regulates rice endosperm 
      development and grain filling via a mechanism highly different from that in 
      Arabidopsis.

AB  - For understanding the mechanism of transcriptional regulation, it is essential to 
      know which transcription factor is bound in vivo to the promoter to be analysed. 
      If transcription from a given promoter is regulated by developmental or 
      environmental stimuli, the question of inducible versus constitutive binding has 
      to be answered, particularly if the transcriptional regulator is expressed both 
      under uninduced and induced conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
      assays constitute the most adequate approach to address these issues as proteins 
      are cross-linked to the DNA before disruption of the tissue. Thus, the 
      DNA-protein interaction is stabilized during purification of the chromatin. The 
      specific DNA-protein complex is immuno-enriched employing specific antibodies 
      against the transcription factor to be analysed. After reversal of cross-links, 
      the recovered DNA is amplified by PCR using specific primers that match sequences 
      flanking the suspected binding site. The amount of PCR product is indicative of 
      the relative abundance of the DNA-protein complex in vivo. A protocol for ChIP 
      assays for Arabidopsis thaliana leaves is described.

TI  - Quantitative RNA expression analysis with Affymetrix Tiling 1.0R arrays 
      identifies new E2F target genes.
PG  - 184-94
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03662.x [doi]
AB  - The Affymetrix ATH1 array provides a robust standard tool for transcriptome 
      analysis, but unfortunately does not represent all of the transcribed genes in 
      Arabidopsis thaliana. Recently, Affymetrix has introduced its Arabidopsis Tiling 
      1.0R array, which offers whole-genome coverage of the sequenced Col-0 reference 
      strain. Here, we present an approach to exploit this platform for quantitative 
      mRNA expression analysis, and compare the results with those obtained using ATH1 
      arrays. We also propose a method for selecting unique tiling probes for each 
      annotated gene or transcript in the most current genome annotation, TAIR7, 
      generating Chip Definition Files for the Tiling 1.0R array. As a test case, we 
      compared the transcriptome of wild-type plants with that of transgenic plants 
      overproducing the heterodimeric E2Fa-DPa transcription factor. We show that with 
      the appropriate data pre-processing, the estimated changes per gene for those 
      with significantly different expression levels is very similar for the two array 
      types. With the tiling arrays we could identify 368 new E2F-regulated genes, with 
      a large fraction including an E2F motif in the promoter. The latter groups 
      increase the number of excellent candidates for new, direct E2F targets by almost 
      twofold, from 181 to 334.
